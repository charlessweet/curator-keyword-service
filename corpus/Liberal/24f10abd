The rusty patched bumblebee was to join the U.S. Endangered Species list today, February 10. After years of work on its behalf by conservationists, the listing was approved on January 10, 2017. On January 20, however, the Trump administration decreed a freeze on implementing regulations approved under Obama that had not yet taken effect. The listing of the bee is now suspended until March 21 -- but subject to review, and may be turned over during that time.

 The rusty patched bumblebee was once abundant across prairies and other grasslands from the upper Midwest to the northeastern U.S. and across much of eastern Canada. Habitat loss and fragmentation are the main reasons for its decline. Also implicated are pathogens and parasites spread by domestic honeybees (which in the U.S. is an introduced species), pesticide exposure in nectar and pollen, and global warming, which can harm bees by increasing the frequency of extreme weather events and through life-cycle shifts that can cause bees to develop out of seasonal sync with their nectar sources. The bee's populations have plunged nearly 90% since the late 1990s, probably as a result of a combination of these factors.

 The right often claims that it is excessively easy to place species on the endangered list, but this bumblebee's story -- which is by no means atypical -- illustrates how lengthy and difficult the process actually is. The listing process formally started with a petition filed with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by the Xerces Society, an invertebrate conservation group, in 2013. Before that, the Xerces Society and bee researchers spent over a decade investigating the biology and status of the species, documenting its decline and assessing its habitat needs. In September 2016, the USFWS announced that after three years of review, it would recommend the species for the endangered list. On January 10, this decision was finalized.

 By contrast, other agencies have moved more swiftly to protect the rusty patched bumblebee. It was listed under the Canadian equivalent of the Endangered Species Act in 2010, and recognized as "critically endangered" by the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the premier global listing agency for imperiled species) in 2014. In general -- across all sorts of taxa, not just insects -- the U.S. tends to lag behind the IUCN in recognizing endangered species.

 Insects are greatly underrepresented on the U.S. endangered list. There are over a million known insect species, and probably five to eight million in all, compared to some 50,000 vertebrates; yet only 84 insects are listed as threatened or endangered in the U.S., vs. 439 vertebrates. Many insects garner little attention from researchers -- due to lack of interest or lack of funding -- and thus it is often difficult to clear the hurdles posed by the USFWS for documenting threats to their populations.

 Why should anyone care about this, or any, wild bee? For one, bees are the premier pollinators of the insect world. Native bees, like the rusty patched bumblebee, and native wildflowers have evolved together over millions of years, and often the native bees are the best, or even the only, pollinators for certain plant species. The six bees that are currently on the U.S. endangered list are Hawaiian natives that pollinate native plants that are themselves endangered, in part because of the decline of these bees. Wild bees often help pollinate crops, as well, and given recent problems with honeybees they have increasingly come to be seen as an important agricultural resource. The rusty patched bumblebee is an excellent pollinator of cranberries, and contributes to the pollination of plums and apples, as well as dozens of wildflowers. Moreover, protecting one species means protecting its habitat, and thus benefits all of the species that live there as well. By protecting and restoring rusty patched bumblebee habitat and reducing its exposure to pesticides, the health of entire ecosystems is supported. Even Richard Nixon understood this! Upon signing the Endangered Species Act in 1973, he issued the following statement:

Nothing is more priceless and more worthy of preservation than the rich array of animal life with which our country has been blessed. It is a many-faceted treasure, of value to scholars, scientists, and nature lovers alike, and it forms a vital part of the heritage we all share as Americans. I congratulate the 93d Congress for taking this important step toward protecting a heritage which we hold in trust to countless future generations of our fellow citizens. Their lives will be richer, and America will be more beautiful in the years ahead, thanks to the measure that I have the pleasure of signing into law today
 The Xerces Society and Natural Resources Defense Council, among others, will continue to advocate for the rusty patched bumblebee. Its fate is worth following, because it is becoming clear that much is now at stake: the Endangered Species Act itself is, well, endangered. Though not controversial when passed by Congress in 1973 (92-0 in the Senate), it has increasingly become the target of legislation designed to weaken it. Since its inception, nearly 300 laws have been introduced  aimed at diminishing various provisions of the Act, 135 of them in the last Congress alone. Most of those did not pass. But now the stars have aligned for Act opponents, with a President who no doubt will rubber-stamp any law that announces itself as pro-development, and GOP lawmakers are rubbing their hands at the prospect. It seems unlikely that Republicans will propose to do away with the Act altogether, given its high levels of popular support. But they may quietly legislate it to death. Already some potentially damaging legislation has been introduced by the new Congress.

 All those rusty patched bees are now quietly snoozing through the winter in underground nests. Will they emerge a protected species, or not? Stay tuned.

Great news. Thanks for this.

But i’m amazed that you didn’t mention the story about Japanese bee drones making the rounds. There have been loads of news articles gushing about how this could be a technological solution to save us, etc. An article in Christian Science Monitor attempts to set things straight.

Should pollinating drones take over for honeybees?

Perhaps an army of robotic pollinators could keep humans well-supplied in these foods, some engineers have thought. And that's just the line of thinking that led a team of researchers in Japan to design a small drone capable of pollinating flowers.

...

Still, Joshua Campbell, an entomologist at the University of Florida who was not involved in the research, says "pollination systems are extremely complex and will always require insects. There is no substitute for ... bees."

This is because pollination systems, and the insects that use them, have evolved together for thousands or millions of years. "They're so intricate, it's not something that we can piece together in a lab and come up with substitutes," he says in a phone interview with the Monitor.
I’m all for using technology for good but my first reaction to seeing these headlines was one of grave disappointment.

My reaction is … ummm… what Dr. Campbell said. Not gonna happen. Trying to conserve bees (both wild and domestic) is the better approach anyways, if long-term sustainability and cost efficiency are desired. Pollinator drones make for a flashy headline but they’re not going to save the world, and they distract from some real problems. If our produce depended on drones to set seed, we wouldn’t be able to afford it.

I agree with you regarding drones.  Chinese fruit producers in some areas already rely on human pollinators.  See link.

I would prefer healthy insect pollinators.

Interesting — this article dates from 2012, I wonder if they have cut back on the pesticides and tried to reintroduce bees since then. This sounds way too labor intensive to be viable for most crops. And bees undoubtedly do a better job!

I don’t know if we have (or had) rusty patched bumblebees here in southern middle TN, but I will look for them. We have many other species of bumblebees, which forage in the garden and on flowering bushes. They especially love our chaste trees (Vitex sp.) and butterfly bushes.  

Some local beekeepers actively kill bumblebees to preserve forage for their honey bees (however honey bees and bumblers don’t always forage on the same plants), yet they overlook the fact that bumblebees do pollinate crops and there are not enough honey bees available to do the job.

All bumblebees are welcome here!

Thank you! I don’t think the rusty patched is in your area, but other bumblebees that may be threatened probably are there. (I’m not a bumblebee expert, but the Xerxes society website, and perhaps your local university extension agency, would have some more specific information.) Threatened species or not, I hate to see them killed.

I can’t imagine him caring about any insect (or really, any living thing) that he wasn’t somehow making money from. 

As far as I know, he didn’t have any comments on the species that was recently named after him — a moth with fluffy yellow “hairs” on its head, and an unusually small penis. 

Entomology is no doubt way under his radar. I doubt he even knows what the word means.

At least.  It’s hard to imagine that there was once a time when every Republican in the Senate (and all but a few in the House) accepted the Act on general principles, and a Republican president would sign off on it. Harder to imagine that it could ever happen again.

Sigh… I have several species of native bees in my ½ acre, as well as two hives of honeybees… and I see how fragile the ecosystem is… stupid, stupid people! It’s like cutting off your foot and not “getting it” that that blood means you’re dying… we are “bleeding” species and are killing ourselves. :-( 

The Endangered Species Act is another thing we need to be very vocal about.

wasplover  CathyM Feb 11 · 05:55:58 AM
 Excellent analogy. It's getting to be a long list of things that we need to speak out on, isn't it? Yes, on being vocal; not least because much of the damage we can expect in the next few years will not be reversible. What I fear is a stealth campaign, one small, little noticed, difficult-to-understand bit of legislation after another, until at some point the Act is eviscerated. Some of these species are very vulnerable and for them these four years could be critical -- more than four, really, as reversing the legislative damage would take longer. Extinct species are not replaceable. Nor is much of the damage inflicted on watersheds, air, ecosystems, human health. I'm not feeling too optimistic these days.

There is nothing sacred but money in TrumpWorld.

Have been a member of NRDC for 20 years; they helped to do all the careful work on this, toward getting the bees listed. It appears that the GOP are now, perhaps, preparing to reverse this. I urge people to join/donate to the NRDC because they know they need more than just good will and money. They are realists: they have lawyers.

They’re the ACLU of the natural world.

Agreed. The NRDC is also on the front lines of the pipeline battles and efforts to defend the EPA.

Put out a container filled with pebbles then add water to just cover the pebbles in the Summer months for pollinators to drink from.

Don’t be afraid of Honeybees, they don't actually want to sting you, they are hard working girls that just want to get on with their job (drones-males don’t have a stinger).
