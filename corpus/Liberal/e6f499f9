MoveOn statement on Pelosi's candidacy for House Democratic Leader
By Brian Stewart. Thursday, November 17 2016
Statement from Ilya Sheyman, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action, on Nancy Pelosi’s candidacy for House Democratic Leader:
 
“After this election, progressives expect Democrats in Congress to stand up for communities targeted by Donald Trump and to do all they can to resist his dangerous and bigoted agenda, which Americans rejected in the national popular vote. Progressives are also counting on congressional Democrats to express a populist and inclusive vision for the future that speaks to Americans across lines of race, class, and geography—a vision for how we can build a democracy that isn’t run by corporations, and an economy that works for everybody, not just those at the top, and a country where all Americans’ rights are respected and equal opportunity is protected. We believe that Nancy Pelosi is best positioned to lead House Democrats in this direction, and support her candidacy for Democratic Leader.”
