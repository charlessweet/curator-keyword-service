With all the news about Ivanka Trump’s clothing line and the negative press I was curious as to what Amazon.com reviewers would have to say about her line.   Well, Amazon users didn’t disappoint.  I took some screen captures and posted below.   I apologize for the crappy embedding, some may  be too small to read.

What are you talking about?  900 billion gazillion people bought the shoes, and they LOVE them, period!  Anyone saying otherwise is fake news!  paid protesters!  Arglebargle!

The question/answer bit on Amazon is hilarious too, e.g.

Question:
Are these shoes going to make me attractive enough for a man to grope me?
Answer:
Only by elderly, dirty old men with spray on tans and combovers.

Question:
Are these appropriate for trampling civil rights?

Those pumps of Ivanka’s aren’t “fuck me” heels. They’re “fuck us” heels.

We shall overcomb this crap.  No...wait.  That isn’t right.  I especially like the “I clicked these heels and the OS is still here.  They don’t work”.
