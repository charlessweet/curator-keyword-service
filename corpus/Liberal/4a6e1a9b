Selfies trump Trump
By Jo Comerford. Thursday, September 22 2016
Amid the constant barrage of hate and negativity from the Trump campaign, it can be natural to get frustrated, even angry. But that’s all the more reason why this is a critical moment to remember what we are hopeful for in this election. Why we’re giving it our all.

Because here’s the thing: The real antidote to Trump’s poisonous words and actions is not more anger; it’s a clear and common vision of the better nation we can and must create together.

That’s why MoveOn’s kicking off our United For campaign. With MoveOn members coast to coast, we’ll harness the energy and inspiration we all need to push through to Election Day (and every day after that).

Will you take a quick picture to share what you’re voting for on Election Day? (It’s really easy to participate. Just click this link to get started!)
