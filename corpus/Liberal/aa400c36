Vets call on GOP leaders to unendorse Trump; MoveOn launches effort to take back Senate as Trump drags down GOP – United Against Hate news 8/19
By Brian Stewart. Friday, August 19 2016
MOVEON AND VETERANS SEND URGENT MESSAGE TO MCCAIN, RUBIO, GOP LEADERS TO UNENDORSE TRUMP. On Thursday, veterans and military family members delivered more than 110,000 petition signatures to the state offices of Sens. John McCain (AZ) and Marco Rubio (FL), as well as Republican Senate nominee Darryl Glenn (CO) calling on top Republican leaders to revoke their endorsement of Donald Trump, following Trump’s attack on Khizr and Ghazala Khan, Gold Star parents. The petition and events are a joint effort by MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC.

Asked about petition delivery, Sen. McCain avoided any opportunity to unendorse Trump and his hateful, racist, and violent rhetoric. NBC News reports: “McCain avoided saying Donald Trump’s name at a national security roundtable event in Phoenix, Arizona, but could not evade a bevy of Trump related questions, including one about a group of veterans poised to deliver 100,000 signatures to his office asking him to denounce Trump. … McCain has said he has ‘strong disagreements’ with Trump but that he supports the Republican party nominee.”

In Phoenix, Fox 10 spoke with Nate Terani, a U.S. Navy veteran and the first American-Muslim invited to join the Navy’s Presidential Honor Guard. Terani was joined by fellow veterans in Phoenix to deliver more than 110,000 signatures Sen. McCain. https://www.facebook.com/FOX10Phoenix/videos/1094401927275020/



In Florida… the Tampa Bay Times reports on the petition delivery: “A group of veterans protested at Sen. Marco Rubio’s Tampa campaign office Thursday, demanding that he withdraw his support of Donald Trump… ‘The leaders within his party cannot support that kind of person for commander-in-chief,’ said Dessia Laxton-Reinke of Tampa. ‘He does not respect the sacrifices of American military families. He does not espouse the values that we defend.’”



In Colorado… “Everything [Trump] represents is against what my family stands for.”: The Colorado Springs Gazette reports on the delivery to Senate candidate Darryl Glenn and the local Republican Party, which refused to accept the petitions. “Crystal Cravens, an Army veteran from Colorado Springs, shamed the local party for not taking the signatures and blasted Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. As a veteran, a black woman, and a mother to a disabled child, Cravens said she can’t support Trump.

MOVEON LAUNCHES EFFORT TO TAKE BACK SENATE – AS TRUMP DRAGS DOWN GOP CANDIDATES – WITH 10 ENDORSEMENTS. MoveOn members in 10 states have now endorsed candidates for Senate, including 7 new endorsements on Thursday as part of a Take Back the Senate effort. The endorsements come as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump continues to drag down incumbent Republicans and GOP hopefuls with his politics of hate, racism, misogyny, Islamophobia, and authoritarianism.

New endorsements this week include: Ann Kirkpatrick (Arizona), Sen. Michael Bennet (Colorado), Maggie Hassan (New Hampshire), Deborah Ross (North Carolina), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nevada), and Katie McGinty (Pennsylvania), as well as Kamala Harris (California). Earlier this year, MoveOn members voted to endorse progressive diplomacy champions Tammy Duckworth (Illinois), Russ Feingold (Wisconsin), and Ted Strickland (Ohio).

“MoveOn members are mobilizing nationwide to ensure Donald Trump never steps foot in the White House – and show that Americans clearly reject his politics of hate – while helping to elect Democrats who can advance progressive policies in Congress,” said Ilya Sheyman, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action. “Bolstered by leading progressive voices like Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders, MoveOn members will help take back the Senate this fall and continue to fight for progressive change at all levels of government.”
