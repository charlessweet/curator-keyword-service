MoveOn Condemns Trump’s Un-American Muslim Ban and Suspension of Refugee Program
By Brian Stewart. Friday, January 27 2017
Washington, DC — According to news reports, moments ago, President Donald Trump signed an executive order restricting refugee access to the United States and suspending immigration from several majority-Muslim countries including Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.

Ilya Sheyman, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action, released the following statement:

“Trump’s executive order banning refugees and creating a de-facto religious test for immigrants is cruel and un-American. This heartless and anti-Muslim act is not based on any legitimate security concern—but rather fear-mongering and prejudice.

“Make no mistake: This is a Muslim ban in all but name. A ban that may cost thousands of men, women, and children their lives and will endanger America.

“To make this announcement on Holocaust Remembrance Day, when Americans are called to reflect on how our country slammed the door on Jewish refugees, sending them back to their deaths in Nazi Germany, is proof that Trump’s cruelty, racism, and dismissal of history knows no bounds.

“We will fight this Islamophobic and dangerous proposal.”
