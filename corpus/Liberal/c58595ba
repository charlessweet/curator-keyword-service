I've read this site pretty much from the beginning, but only started posting recently.  One thing I have noticed is that there is a lot of bashing of newbies.  I have mad respect for those of you who have been active for years.  I have voted in every election I could (save for 2012 which was two days after I was suddenly widowed), I may not have been as active as some but I have always considered voting to be a duty not a right.

i am running for city council where I am, it is my start.  I've lived here four years and never had any politician knock on my door.  I'm about to go knock on my neighbors door (yes I know them).  

We we are looking at a groundswell of enthusiasm and activism the likes of which I haven't seen in my lifetime and none of us may never see again.

Yes, we are uneducated in activism.  Yes we are naive.  But we are anxious to be a part of this.  Do not tear us down.  A rising tide lifts all boats.

thank you for reading, for educating, and encouraging.

Thank you for this. I’ve been here for about 2½ years and haven’t even written a diary yet.

I applaud your running for a seat on your cities Council and if that’s not getting involved and making a difference, I don’t know what is.

I sincerely hope you win that seat.

My heart aches for your loss.

When I first posted here I was accused of being a “sock puppet”. Why, because the first diary I decided to comment on I agreed with the author (somewhat) on a topic with which the accusers (active members here several of whose names I well remember) disagreed. They went as far as to “report me” whatever that means, which obviously came to nothing as I am who I am and if the administrators even cared to check they would know that we were different people pretty quick.

Little is as insulting as trying to undercut someone’s opinions by denying the reality of their being. I see this over and over here (in a few different flavors) and really wonder how people can justify this kind of behavior to themselves. Do they really think they are so smart they can read people from a few lines? Do they fancy themselves as some sort of police, with this their only outlet to feel powerful? Sad and pathetic for sure, but also self defeating as so many new people are driven off by this horrific "welcome". Just the carefully placed passive agressive words “welcome newbie” are used as a common way to undercut the credulity of one with whom they disagree. That behavior, sadly, appears to be all too well tolerated.

Had Enough Right Wing BS  Pirran Feb 11 · 02:49:44 PM
I can see both sides of this.

At times I have recognized idiosyncrasies of “new member’s writing that was strikingly similar to that of other posters (who either had been banned or who seemed to form a mutual protection society with the person I suspected).

I’ve never called anyone out on this (which is, or can be, a “bannable” thing itself). Most of the time it’s only a day or two before either someone else reports them or the admins catch it themselves.

On the other side, when someone is using scathing language to admonish the Democratic Party or people who have been active here for a long time, but their account is ten years old and they’ve made only a couple of dozen comments and authored no diaries, it seems entirely pertinent to point out that their level of criticism doesn’t seem to match their level of engagement.

Sometimes it’s just a matter of someone being very jarring because they aren’t thinking about the fact that another person is reading what they post. Other times it looks pretty clear that their intent is to stir up trouble.

People can take unpopular positions without wildly jumping to the most insulting way that their thought could be expressed. In fact, in my experience that’s far more likely to convince or persuade.

Nastiness just for the sake of nastiness—no matter how long anyone has posted here is a big turn off, and more people will read it most of the time than will comment on it. It’s not a good way to behave after a week or a decade.

My second diary here was flamed to a crisp. Not long ago, I was temporarily banned (rightly so, but, damn, was it worth it) for something I’d said about a Supreme Court justice. People I’ve liked and admired here for years regularly piss me off.

Not really sure what you are taking about. There are a few things you might want to consider. Not everyone here is who or what they say they are. There are many whose sole goal is to sow division and discourage others among Democrats and progressives — right here. There are also a lot of smart people, experienced people, and people just starting out. Steel yourself for the attacks.They will come from people in the area you are running for office. It’s a given. But don’t give up. It’s hard awn first but every attack makes you better. It makes you learn to state very clearly what you believe and what you want to do in whatever office. people that are driven off easily will be eaten alive during any political race. That’s not right nor is it very encouraging. But we need you to stay strong, stand tall and inspire others. A politician that appears needy or insecure will never be popular. Be real. Be yourself. Be secure. Listen to people. Don’t be a doormat though. Or they will treat you with little respect. Sorry if this sounds harsh or non-supportive but it’s the truth. Republicans will eat you alive. They don’t care about your feelings or even your needs. Get in there and change the system!

I'm not afraid of attacks, but there are people who are. We need everyone! That's my point. Don't scare away a timid newbie who may be tomorrow's front page story. People need acceptance, that's in part why we lost. Do we want these newbies to lose interest?

Good diary. Yea, it’s been that way here for the last twelve months. One of the problems here is if you have an opinion other than a few of the wrong people who happen to be on the same diary as you, they can get you banned for a period of time. This leads to a groupthink where debate isn’t allowed and rationality is suppressed. Up until the day after the election, they had a banner at the top of the page proclaiming Hillary had a 90% chance of being elected! They could not have been more wrong. You would think that would lead to some serious soul searching after such a devastating defeat, but no, they’re sticking to calling Trump, his cabinet and the people who voted for him stupid while calling progressives naïve. Hopefully, the climate will improve here to the point where debate and dissent are encouraged rather than punished.

SparkyGump, that is all rather shocking and disheartening. Kos’s diaries (Kos the person) give you a little insight into why there is so much vitriol. He sets the tone. If this gets me banned, it was really nice knowing you all!

Welcome!

Congrats on having the guts to run for city council.  I’m assuming you’re in TX.  Where, if I might ask?  (I’m from Austin).

As with any group we can all do more to welcome the new people. But some of the things I’ve seen are:

Newcomers running for a position against a long-term member, and not realizing and/or recognizing it.
Newcomers repeating conversations (especially “Bernie-or-bust” or “Hillary-or-bust”, colloquially called “rox/sux” posts as one side bashes the other) that have longer-term members want to tear their hair out.
 In wanting more progressives all fighting the good fight, my humble suggestions for new members is:

Listen first before speaking. Learn what conversations have already happened, so we can all have new conversations.
Introduce yourselves. If you say you’re a newbie, good people will try to guide you instead of jumping on you. (And, as in any online forum, just ignore the haters.)
Don’t get discouraged if your posts don’t get a lot of feedback.  The site has grown large enough that it’s hard to break into existing conversations. More people read your posts than you know, even if they don’t flag it or comment.
This isn’t an official DailyKos welcome post. It’s just what I’ve seen on the site as a member. And what I’ve seen when joining new groups, on-line and in-real-life.

And it looks like we’ve got a dog that could be a photo negative of yours :-)

And thanks for calling out the haters.

Congratulations. I admire you for your ability to have public presence. We need many more to do as you are doing. I am a newbie also. Always voted, etc etc.

My life has time now to more politically. For those that say why weren’t you there before, etc. etc. Because I could not be. I am here now and so I really hope there is an adequate “welcome” not just here but in all the diverse grassroots organizations to use the Yuge response to the Yuge need to save our country/our world.

I have been talking to my 22 yr old daughter and her responses are disheartening. These are the young peeps who were electrified by Bernie, voted for Hillary and then got fried by the electoral college win of Trump. They are discouraged and apparently not up for being active now. I think might be worth considering on a national level. Not a big sample but likely meaningful.

Went off topic—but I am so proud of you. I am too old to be a public face but I am doing what I can.  Please tell people what you need in your campaign. You will be stunned by the help.

DK can be a little intimidating.  There are a lot of very experienced bloggers and politicos here.  I joined only a year ago and I was shocked by the amount of vitriol between Hillary and Bernie supporters.  I was shocked by the way people attacked others and what they were willing to say. 

Be yourself and use your voice to express your views and values.  People do not have to agree, and it they attack tell them they are entitled to their opinions and you to yours.

There is often ego involved…….

The people united will never be defeated!

Good points about over-zealous policing by regulars.  I understand they see actual bad-faith behavior that can put them on a hair trigger, but it really is better to give people a little room to prove themselves.  It doesn’t take long for true concern trolls, sock puppets and the like to be really obvious, so why jump the gun?

It is hard to ignore when you are not familiar enough with the regulars to be able to tell who is hazing and who is bringing up good points. I try to listen and learn but I have made some mistakes. Some have been generous and have patiently provided explanations. Others, often those without real knowledge, have attacked and been rude.   But the more time one spends here the easier it is to shrug it off, and I have not let it stop me from being here roughly every 15 minutes during the day. I would have a hard time without this place.

1,000 Tips & Recs!  Thank you kimmytx for your compassionate, mature plea. It should be second nature to everyone here, but alas some people fall into nasty Keyboard Warrior habits. I’ve seen way way too much of that clicquey snarky clubiness and in fact I left Kos for many months for that exact reason, until recently. Inclusion is vital. Debate is vital. Self-criticism (Dems) is vital.

Activism is a necessary and vital part of a functional democracy.  I’ve been around long enough to have seen activism in the 1960’s, that eventually our leaders and changed policies.  One thing that activists today might find helpful is this information written and shared by former Hill staffers who learned a few things during their time working in offices of Members of Congress.  They put together this guide:
