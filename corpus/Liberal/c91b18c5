When Jews around the world gather to celebrate the holiday of Passover, which commemorates our bondage as slaves in Egypt and our liberation from the Pharaoh, at the center of our observance is the seder plate. Sitting at the middle of the table, it is laden with several different foodstuffs that remind us of our experience, our memory, and our history.

One of these items is a beitzah—an egg, specifically a roasted one. There are many reasons this boiled and burnt egg is part of the Passover meal, but each year, my mother regaled us with her favorite. Every other food, she would tell us, falls apart when placed into hot water—but not the egg. Boil an egg and it only knits together more firmly.

So, too, have the Jews: Down the millennia, constantly placed in hot water, the Jewish people have only bonded together more tightly, just like the miraculous egg. That makes the beitzah a perfect metaphor for the Jewish experience.

And to take my mother’s story one step further, it puts me in mind of the resistance to Donald Trump. The stooges and lackeys working their hardest to damage America and the world in the name of Trumpism only understand power and violence, and they think that lashing out at opponents of the regime will cause us to cower and splinter.

Only the exact opposite has happened. Every attack, every outrage, every insult, every attempt to divide us has only pulled the resistance more securely together—and brought more people into the movement to fight Trump each and every day. Our enemies will continue to assault us, but they will only be astounded by what results.

We are indivisible. We grow stronger. We are the egg.

Hi, dru!

You’ll like this, I bet: I once lived someplace where the expression of admiration/respect for being gutsy was, “wow, s/he’s got a pair of brass beitzim!” :D

You bet I liked this! Truly laughed out loud (startled Kobi) ! Then I thought… what are beitzim? I think I know… but I could be wrong. Could be candlesticks.

In the diary, David Nir says that’s the Hebrew for eggs (on the seder plate).

In human terms, it’s the women who have the eggs, soooo…. !!!

Yep! “Beitzim” is plural for “beitzah.”

I love Passover and Easter. Both are rooted in the deepest layers of culture and tradition. Both embody heartening promises.

Thanks for the diary.

I think people are feeling more and more determined. They are flooding meetings and building networks and asking “What can we do TOGETHER, because we are stronger together?”

Thanks, David, for the parable.  I have always been an entirely secular Jew.   That said, I find that I’m clinging to my Jewish heritage more and more in the *45 era.  This is the first time in my life that I have felt under assault.  Today I read on fb about a Jewish man here in NY’s bright blue Capital District, who had three swastikas painted on his house yesterday.  I marched with hundreds of my fellow citizens after our local Jewish Community Center, which has a sizeable daycare, received its second bomb threat in as many weeks.  Aside from that, stories like the one you tell here offer a tiny window into why our community continues to endure.

This is an extremely dangerous moment, perhaps the most dangerous since the 1983 nuclear scare under Reagan, and I don’t mean to minimize the awfulness of it (I’m not getting any more sleep than you are, pilgrim). However, the one hopeful element in this national tragedy/fiasco is that the criminal perpetrators are so incredibly stupid. They celebrate their own ignorance; they built a movement based on ignorance. I didn’t expect to see an intelligent, efficient fascist agenda unfolding after January 20th, but I also never could have predicted the utterly stupendous jubilee of incompetence we’ve seen in the past three weeks. They hold most of the cards, but they don’t seem to know what game they are playing. I now think any evil genius/master plan/70 dimension chess arguments about what is happening have been conclusively debunked by the nonstop parade of moronic disasters these cretins have brought upon themselves. The German Nazi leadership was nothing close to a brain trust, on average, but these clowns make them look like the Evil Governance All Star Team. Lots of irreparable damage is being done, real people are getting hurt and everything is likely to get much worse before it gets better. But we can take these bozos out, I know we can.

What a wonderful story. Thank you for sharing it, as I will at my seder. One question, though: in the photo of the seder plate, what is that thing between the charoseth and the moror? It looks like an onion. In my home there’s a leaf of romaine in that slot.

Our family traditionally has a boiled potato on the plate. I guess meat was scarce in the old country.

They celebrate Seder at our church to help remind us of our Jewish roots and to better appreciate the rich traditions of the faith.
