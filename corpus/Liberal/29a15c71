More disdain for transparency and tradition from the Trump administration.

From The Hill:

Members of President Trump's press pool on Saturday said they were kept from tagging along as the president golfed with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Trump and Abe are at the president's Jupiter, Fla., golf club for the weekend after a meeting and press conference Friday at the White House.
But it’s okay folks. The expected and utterly necessary role of the press watching and documenting the president’s every move has been replaced by the arbitrary tweets of, you guessed it, the president himself.

 Freedom of the press relegated to 120-characters-or-less.

Trump tweeted photos of the two from the golf course, but reporters in both his and Abe's press pools shared photos from inside the golf club, where they were left during the golfing session.
And this isn’t the first time he’s pulled this

He ditched his press pool to golf back in December and left his press pool to go out to dinner last November.
No pictures please. Might get a shot of him looking/sounding/acting the fool.

And we wouldn’t want that would we.

Most likely he didn’t want someone overhearing his personal business dealings with the PM.

More likely, president fraud wants no witnesses when he loses on his OWN course.

Cheetollini’s staff didn't want any press around when the orange oaf asked Abe if he wanted to go out for some chop suey after the round.
