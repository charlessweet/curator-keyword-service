Reflections on the 2016 Election
By Brian Stewart. Thursday, November 10 2016
This is a disaster.

We fought our hearts out to avert this reality. But now it’s here.

The new president-elect and many of his most prominent supporters have targeted, demeaned, and threatened millions of us—and millions of our friends, family, and loved ones. Both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands. We are entering an era of profound and unprecedented challenge, a time of danger for our communities and our country.

In this moment, we have to take care of ourselves, our families, and our friends—especially those of us who are on the front lines facing hate, including Latinos, women, immigrants, refugees, Black people, Muslims, LGBT Americans, and so many others.

And we need to make it clear that we will continue to stand together.

In the days to come, we will have to pick ourselves up and fight for America’s better ideals.

We’ve known vast darkness before. Each time, brave Americans have risen to the challenge. This time must be no different.

The MoveOn community and our allies will continue to work—tirelessly—to resist Trump’s agenda, contain the damage, defeat hate with love, and begin the process of swinging the nation’s pendulum back towards sanity, decency, and the kind of future that we must never give up on.

If you are afraid, know that you are not alone—because we stand together. If you feel despair, know that things will change—because we will change them together.

More than 250 million Americans did not choose Trump. In fact, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. The millions of us—MoveOn members and allies—who spent countless hours knocking on doors, making phone calls, and defending democracy can be proud of what we did together.

We need to take time to process how this happened, what it means, and what kind of country we now live in.

Together, we will fight to keep our light and resolve alive, sustain our gratitude for each other, and stand unwavering in our conviction that we will never, ever give up.

Thanks for all that you’ve done—and all that you will do in the times ahead.
