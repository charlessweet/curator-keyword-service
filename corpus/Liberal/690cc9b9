104 Actual Headlines From Alex Jones’ Infowars
Blog ››› February 8, 2017 8:52 AM EST ››› ERIC HANANOKI & BEN DIMIERO



Alex Jones has claimed that his Infowars website will soon receive credentials to attend President Donald Trump’s White House press briefings. But Infowars has no credibility; it has repeatedly posted bizarre and dangerous conspiracy theories along with false claims and hoaxes.

Jones and Infowars have claimed that the government perpetrated the 9/11 attacks and the tragedies at Columbine, Oklahoma City, Sandy Hook, and the Boston Marathon, among others. The site’s editor, Paul Joseph Watson, apparently has no editorial standards and has repeatedly posted fraudulent information.

The incredible number of events Infowars can filter through a conspiracy lens would be hilarious if the site and its proprietor weren’t influential with the president and his closest allies. Headlines about Lady Gaga performing a “satanic ritual” during the Super Bowl halftime show share space with stories labeling most major terror attacks “false flags” and warnings about the New World Order “opening thousands of portals to ancient demons” or staging an “alien invasion” from space.  

Jones recently announced that the purported news organization would be attending White House press briefings and that it has hired widely discredited reporter Jerome Corsi as its D.C. correspondent.

Infowars appearing in the White House briefing room would mean press secretary Sean Spicer would be questioned by one of Trump’s most sycophantic outlets.

Trump and his campaign have repeatedly elevated the once-fringe website. Trump appeared on Jones’ program during the presidential campaign and apparently called Jones after the election to thank his audience for its support. Trump adviser and regular contributor Roger Stone told The Washington Post that Trump “has watched Infowars.” Trump has also tweeted a link to Infowars. 

Here are over 100 headlines demonstrating the type of coverage and credibility Infowars would bring to the White House press corps. The headlines are separated into the following sections: 9/11 conspiracy theories, “false flag” events, fringe/bizarre/incendiary conspiracy theories, Sandy Hook, women/sexism, Obama conspiracy theories, environment and science, LGBTQ, culture, and pro-Trump. (These are just a sampling of the many terrible headlines on Infowars.)
