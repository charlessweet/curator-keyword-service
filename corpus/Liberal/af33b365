Trump Ally Jeffrey Lord: “No One Cares” That Kellyanne Conway Violated Ethics Laws Promoting Ivanka Trump’s Brand
Lord, A CNN Commentator, Calls The Violation "Emblematic Of An Anti-Private Sector Feeling That Has Control Of Washington"
Video ››› February 10, 2017 11:49 AM EST ››› MEDIA MATTERS STAFF

From the February 10 edition of CNN Newsroom with John Berman and Poppy Harlow:

POPPY HARLOW (CO-HOST): Do you think, Jeffrey, that Kellyanne Conway owed an apology to the president for that? 

JEFFREY LORD: I'm sure she probably felt that way, but to be candid, I think this whole thing is ridiculous. And it goes to the broader point here --

HARLOW: Why is it ridiculous, Jeffrey? Jason Chaffetz, a Republican, along with Democrats on the House Oversight Committee sent a letter to the Government Ethics Office saying this is a clear violation of the ethics code. 

LORD: I understand. Poppy, this is emblematic of an anti-private sector feeling that has control of Washington, sometimes, frankly, in both parties. What about the politicians who use their office for political profit to run for another office? Why don't we start looking at how the political system works here instead of just the private sector. 

HARLOW: Jeffrey Lord, that's not OK. Does it make this OK? Does it make it OK for Kellyanne Conway to use time paid for by the American taxpayer to hawk clothing of the president's daughter and tell people they should buy that? Does that make any sense? 

LORD: Kellyanne did not profit from this. Period. She's not Ivanka Trump. This is not like Ivanka was secretary of state and stood up there and said buy my stuff. This is somebody else saying it.

JOHN BERMAN (CO-HOST): But, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, just to be clear, just to be clear, Kellyanne Conway is being paid with taxpayer dollars. Is it OK for our taxpayer dollars, yours, Governor Granholm's, to be paying a senior adviser to the president to be selling clothes and accessories from the White House? 

LORD:  John, John, no one cares. No one cares unless they've got something politically to profit from it. No one cares out here in America. We've got ISIS. We've got the economy. We've got all these things. This is exactly the kind of thing that is emblematic of what's wrong with how Washington operates.
