MoveOn.org Hiring Dozens of Organizers in 8 Battleground States, Kicking Off Major ‘United Against Hate’ Field Effort to Defeat Trump, and Win the Senate
By Brian Stewart. Thursday, August 25 2016
More than three dozen paid staff will organize in eight key battleground states – where the group has more than 1 million active members – to lead a massive door-to-door volunteer canvassing operation that taps into MoveOn’s millions of members nationwide.

In an expansion of MoveOn.org’s United Against Hate campaign to prevent Donald Trump from winning the White House while demonstrating that hatred, racism, misogyny, and xenophobia are a losing strategy, MoveOn.org Political Action is hiring dozens of organizers to serve as state directors and field organizers in eight battleground states through November.

The hiring push will create a major field presence in key states — including Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania — where organizers and MoveOn volunteers will work to defeat Donald Trump and elect Hillary Clinton, and help take back control of Senate, by recruiting, training, and supporting grassroots leaders, focusing on communities that Trump has attacked and coordinating volunteer teams who will knock on hundreds of thousands of doors and hold conversations with thousands of likely voters in coming weeks.

MoveOn.org is building robust field programs with paid organizers and volunteer leaders in Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. MoveOn has more than 1 million active members in these states.

MoveOn members have voted to endorse Senate candidates in seven of the eight states: Ann Kirkpatrick (Arizona), Patty Judge (Iowa), Maggie Hassan (New Hampshire), Deborah Ross (North Carolina), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nevada), Ted Strickland (Ohio), and Katie McGinty (Pennsylvania) as part of an effort to elect a Democratic majority in the Senate this fall.

“This is an all-hands-on-deck moment to ensure that Donald Trump never sets foot in the White House, and MoveOn members across the country have the power to influence this election by helping elect Hillary Clinton and winning key Senate seats across the country,” said Victoria Kaplan, Organizing Director for MoveOn.org. “We know that face-to-face conversations with voters are the number one most effective way to increase voter participation, and that’s why we’re unleashing the phenomenal energy of volunteer leaders and the millions of MoveOn members to canvass their own neighborhoods and communities, where they can make the biggest difference.”

“We know that our task is not just to win an election, but to demonstrate that bigotry is a losing strategy and to build power to win on the issues that matter to everyday people: income inequality, police and criminal justice reform, climate change, good jobs, immigrants’ rights, and more,” said MoveOn National Spokesperson and Senior Advisor Karine Jean-Pierre.

Earlier this year, MoveOn members voted to launch a multi-million dollar effort to stop Donald Trump and keep him out of the White House and ensure the country rejects his politics of hate, racism, misogyny, Islamophobia, and authoritarianism. Since then, MoveOn has kicked off a major voter contact effort, opened a rapid-response video lab to produce dynamic content around the election, launched a nationwide Laughter Trumps Hate comedy contest, and published an open letter featuring more than 100 prominent artists standing against Trump.
