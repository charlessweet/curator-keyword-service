Here are some of the more than 5,000 supporters of Planned Parenthood who turned out in St. Paul Saturday to counter the protest of forced-birthers who seek to defund the women's health organization.

Forced-birthers across the nation participated in more than 200 protests against Planned Parenthood Saturday organized by the #ProtestPP Coalition. Their purpose: To show support for the latest effort in Congress to defund the organization.

In several cases, counter-protesters showed up. No more so than in St. Paul, Minnesota. There, the defunding backers numbered about 500 at their peak, according to police. But at least 10 times as many counter-protesters in support of Planned Parenthood showed up. The two protests were occasionally loud but peaceful. 


Here’s Miguel Otárola at the Minneapolis Star-Tribune:

The dueling protests were one of several planned around the Twin Cities Saturday on issues ranging from abortion to immigration to race relations. Nationwide, protests have been larger and more frequent since President Donald Trump’s inauguration, as both his opponents and supporters find their motivations and momentum growing. [...]

Of the 9,861 abortions recorded by the Minnesota Health Department in 2015, more than half — 5,048 — were performed at a Planned Parenthood clinic. But only one of the 18 Minnesota clinics provides abortion services.

The clinics serve about 24,000 Medicaid patients a year, according to Planned Parenthood. Low-income patients make up 65 percent of the patients.
Defunding is something reproductive rights activists say will harm women’s health—particularly low-income women’s health—because so many use Planned Parenthood for free or low-cost birth control, screening and counseling for sexually transmitted infections and diseases, pregnancy testing and counseling, HIV testing and counseling, and annual gynecological exams. At some Planned Parenthood facilities, a woman can also get an abortion. While no federal funding can pay for abortions except in the rare cases of pregnancies that result from incest, rape or that endanger the woman’s life, the government does provide money to the organization for those other services.

This makes no never-mind to the forced-birthers. They say the fact that some Planned Parenthood operations perform abortions means none of them should be funded. What that means, of course, is that more women are likely to need abortions because they can’t afford birth control, and that many of them will suffer from afflictions that might otherwise have been prevented or caught early in their development. 

In addition to their efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, many forced-birthers like to harass women who use the organization for their health needs. Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, says that one very encouraging thing the organization has seen since the election in November is an “explosion” in the number of people who volunteer to escort women past the harassers.

Here we go.  So proud of all those counter-protesters.  I will be training in March to register voters — and my go to spot is going to be offices of Planned Parenthood.  We can do this, one voter at a time.

I was at the counter-demonstration today in Redwood City, CA and I estimated the crowd to be about 10-1 in favor of Planned Parenthood.   There were all ages and genders, all manner of pink attire, all sorts of chants and songs and, of course, wonderful inspiring signs.  We were advised to keep the signs positive and most of them were.  Still, my favorite said “Mind Your Own Uterus!”

Create a diary or comment. On the right hand side of the line of ICONS is one that looks like the moon over a mountain range. Click on that and it will open up the Image Library. From there you can call up your photo from your file or Desktop and place it in the library. Be sure to fill out the tags AND attribution slots. Then you can Choose your photo and place it in a comment or diary. There is at the top left a handle you can click on to move the photo around. Also the text centering icon allows you to make the photo larger than when it is left or right justified.

Thanks for the on-site report.  PP is my favourite charity.  They helped me when I was young and had no insurance and I've never forgotten them.  I donate to them regularly.

That’s wonderful.  I have been a regular donor for a long time, but now I direct my donations to the PP Action Fund which supports direct political and legal action.  It seems that this kind of help is needed urgently now.

I hate the term "defunding," as if PP gets some big check every year. They get the same federal money as any other medical service provider that a patient chooses.

Chartreuxe  SheLawyer Feb 11 · 02:14:19 PM
Actually, women with no money and no choice go to PP.  They have no insurance and no money to purchase insurance or medical care.  

It doesn't sound as though you've ever been forced to use their services so don't speak for Planned Parenthood.  They're a lifesaver for many of us.  Some women give birth to all their children while receiving all of their prenatal care through PP.  Failure to receive that Federal funding means that women and children will go without health care, or did you have another thought in mind?

I think you misunderstood my comment. I'm a 100% supporter of PP and donate to them on a monthly basis. Maybe I didn't convey my thoughts in the best way.

You should read more carefully, SheLawyer wasn’t saying anything negative about PP, she was just stating an objection to the use of the term “defunding” by conservatives. Your comment was quite shrill. You should apologize IMHO.

Just left support-PP rally in downtown Denver an hour ago...held outside Sen. Cory Gardner’s office. Lots of chanting “We’re Not Paid!” I’d guess 3000+ attending; no counter-protesters. The energy continues!

Made me go look.  According to one observer

“A rally of about 200 anti-abortion activists proceeded through their agenda without much ruckus today outside Planned Parenthood of the Rockies, though a group of 10-15 counter protesters sparked a few arguments toward the end.”

Enlightend billionaires anyone? Healthcare and reproductive rights/ervices should not be at the mercy of our most uneducated,racist and fanatically religious voters among us but thanks to the electoral college those 5,000 are the actual minority.We need to start funding the world we want live in ourselves.

Lots of us non-billionaires donate regularly to Planned Parenthood. I have for more than 40 years. But health care of all types should be government-funded, not dependent on donations, even from billionaires.

P.P. does so much more than choice. We need to bull horn those issues. Health care for all- not just women. Advocacy for: legislation, inclusion, family planning, prevention, breast feeding clinics, paps, affordable menstruation supplies, education, STD tests/support, sexual assault info,  L,G,B,T,Q community , etc. Was down this past week to lobby the state legislators (first time down there in 30 years) on a  few issues. The P.P. person was great. There were 5 different bills. For a conservative senator, (that is all for lower taxes) took just the bill about not taxing women’s hygiene products. They are not cheep. Lack of supply leads to lost work/school, health problems and more. He treated a small, disabled, polite,  middle aged woman with such disrespect that I look forward to being a burr in his saddle.

FTR, both national and local legislative advocacy is handled by different, though obviously connected, PP organizations.

So here’s a photo from the Redwood City counter demonstration.  My first attempt to post a photo.  The demonstrator stood quietly next to the forced birther, calling attention only to the ludicrous man in the hat who had nothing better to do with his day than interfere with women’s rights.

The thing about anti-family planning protests is that they’re unwitting rallies in favor of family planning, the people who attend them being poster children for same. You only need one person to stand next to them holding a sign saying “You people are proof of why we need family planning!” to shut them down completely. Mean, yes, but TRUE.

Sorry, John in Denver-there was something out side of Gardner’s office today. Do not get the Denver paper. Was at something in my home town. Kind of surprised did not get an email from them. Might have to reconsider getting a smart phone and joining FB and the rest.

It’s February 11 and it’s 82 degrees inside my house.  This is not normal. Normal is scraping ice off the driveway so I can go to the grocery store.  Yeah, I know, this is weather, not climate.  But all winter long?
