THE CFPB / Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is under attack by the drumpf/trump-pence administration, and may be eliminated, if people don't demand congress protects it and keep it fully funded. Wall Street and the bank-financial cabal hate the CFPB, that should be proof enough we need to fight for it. This is class warfare, the American people vs the 1% and corporate greed. +Senator Elizabeth Warren is sounding the alarm, it is up to us to contact our senators and representative ( I did, my e mails to +U.S. Senator Tim Kaine D VA, Sen +Mark Warner D VA and +Congresswoman Barbara Comstock r VA after this article and I also posted them on their facebook pages (pending approval) ) and demand congress keep the CFPB open, unfettered and fully funded. Contact information for your senators can be found here and your representative here. This from +AlterNet ...…

MY e mails to Senators Kaine and Warner

Republicans in Congress want the CFPB shut down. We, the American people, need the protection from the fraud, cheating and excess fees Wall Street and the bank-financial cabal would subject us to without the CFPB and the Dodd-Frank regulations now in place. I expect you to stand strong with the American people and Sen Elizabeth Warren and keep the CFPB open, unfettered and fully funded. Do not be a DINO, we need you to more than ever to protect us from the Trump-Pence administration and the Republican controlled Congress. 
Sincerely,

MY e mail to Rep Comstock
Many Republicans in Congress want the CFPB shut down. We, the American people, need the protection from the fraud, cheating and excess fees Wall Street and the bank-financial cabal would subject us to without the CFPB and the Dodd-Frank regulations now in place. I expect you to stand strong with the American people and Sen Elizabeth Warren and keep the CFPB open, unfettered and fully funded. Do not be rubber stamp Republican, we need you to more than ever to protect us from the greed of Wall Street and the bank-financial cabal, those who brought us the 2008 recession.

Out of the 12 links in this story, 5 are to your website, 5 are to dodgy “plus.google.com” pages with either no content at all or nothing that has been updated since 2014, and 2 are to legitimate government web-pages.

You did the same thing with your other comment here today, where 5 out of 6 links are to your website, and 1 to another dodgy “plus.google.com” page which hasn’t been updated since 2014.

If I were a suspicious person, I just might suspect you were attempting to use Daily Kos solely to promote clicks to your site.

I used your letter as a template to e-mail my congressman Greg Walden, OR-2. Thank you for the nudge!
