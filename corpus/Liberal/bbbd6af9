Fox’s Jeanine Pirro: Trump's Muslim Ban Is Targeted At "Joe Schmo Muhammad"
Pirro: Trump's Ban Is About "Joe Schmo Muhammad," Who Is From A Country "Where They Promised To Send In Individuals And Jihadists To Kill Us"

From the February 10 edition of Fox News' Fox & Friends:

JEANINE PIRRO: This is -- and let me make one thing perfectly clear: If you are not a citizen of the United States of America, you do not have the right to come to the United States, period, end of the story. The president has a plenary authority, the power to determine who comes into this country. And all this talk about constitutional rights -- if you are from Somalia, I got a news flash, you do not have constitutional rights in this country. And, Congress has agreed with the plenary power authority of the president in terms of national security and immigration with, what is it, 8 USC, what is it, 1182-F. When they said that the president at any time can make a decision to block an alien from coming to this country. So it's not about people with green cards. It's about Joe Schmo Muhammad, who doesn't have any vetting from another country that -- where they promised to send in individuals and jihadists to kill us.
