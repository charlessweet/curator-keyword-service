Social Media and Community Engagement Intern
By Joshua Wolf. Friday, September 16 2016
TEMPORARY, PART-TIME • STARTS ASAP, ENDS NOV 18 • $25/HOUR • WORK ANYWHERE IN THE CONTINENTAL U.S.

SUMMARY

Do you have what it takes to stop Donald Trump? Do you believe in the power of games? Trump is polling neck-in-neck with Hillary Clinton, and MoveOn is building the biggest distributed canvassing effort in the U.S. to stop him.

MoveOn is partnering with renowned game designer Jane McGonigal to create a special election get-out-the-vote game to be released later this fall, and we’re looking for a Social Media and Community Engagement Intern to help build a community of players so we can help stop Donald Trump, elect Hillary Clinton, and take back the Senate.

 

Personal, one-on-one conversations with neighbors and friends have long been the gold standard for motivating people to go vote. We’re applying this same winning concept to developing a brand new game to encourage MoveOn’s millions of members to canvass their own social networks and make sure voters in battleground states reject Trump and his platform of hate—and pull the lever for Clinton.

 

If even a small fraction of MoveOn members play this game, it could add up to thousands of additional votes for Clinton, which could make the difference in the election.

The Social Media and Community Engagement Intern will work as part of a tight-knit team of game developers, designers, and campaigners to help foster a community of players who could swing this election, and creating content to promote the game and encouraging new players to join. Nimbleness is a must—the election is only weeks away, and the game will continue to evolve based on player feedback.
