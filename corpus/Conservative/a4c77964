Speaking during a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Friday from the White House, President Trump responded to Thursday night's ruling from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upholding the suspension of his recent travel ban.

"Ultimately, I have no doubt that we'll win that particular case," Trump said. "We will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm..."We're going to keep our country safe."

Moving forward, the administration has two main options: Take the case to the Supreme court or rewrite the executive order be narrowly focused.

During an interview with Fox News last night, White House Special Counselor Kellyanne Conway expressed confidence in the administration's ability to prevail. 

"We are fully confident now that we will get our day in court and have an opportunity to argue this on merits," she said.
