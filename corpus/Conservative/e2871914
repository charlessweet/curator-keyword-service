‚ÄòPOLITICS THROUGH AND THROUGH!‚Äô MARK LEVIN IS FED UP WITH LIBERAL JUDGES AND THEIR BS

Back in action after a brief respite, Conservative Review Editor-in-Chief Mark Levin came out guns blazing Tuesday night against the rogue federal judiciary stealing American sovereignty.

First, Levin explained how the president‚Äôs executive order on immigration was lawful, and further, how the federal judge has ‚Äúno jurisdiction, whatsoever‚Äù to rule here. Then he expounded on the radical left-wing politics that has poisoned our court system.¬†

Listen:



‚ÄúThis is politics through and through. This has politics all over it!‚Äù declared Levin. ‚ÄúPresident Trump had every right to do what he did.‚Äù

But the left-wing activists in the judiciary care more for their ideology than for the rule of law. That is why it is time for conservatives to examine the judicial branch of government and demand reform.

‚ÄúIt is long past time that we examine that branch of government,‚Äù Levin said. ‚ÄúThe judicial review power of the court, you won‚Äôt find that in the Constitution.‚Äù

It is a power that is dangerous.

‚ÄúWhen a judge uses the rule of law to attack the rule of law, he‚Äôs doing more damage to this country than any other public figure!‚Äù Levin roared. ‚ÄúBecause then the law is used to destroy the law.‚Äù
