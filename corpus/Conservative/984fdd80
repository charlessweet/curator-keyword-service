Dominican Newspaper Can’t Tell Trump And Alec Baldwin Apart

I want to say this was a joke, but the accompanying article appears to be serious.

Dominican newspaper El Nacional on Friday printed a photo of Alec Baldwin doing his impression of President Trump on “Saturday Night Live” in an article about Trump and Israel.
Is this something that routinely goes on in the Dominican press, where they mix satire with otherwise serious news?

Again, I have no idea. Someone with a bit more inside knowledge will have to fill me in, but if this wasn’t intentional, that particular paper needs a better editor.
