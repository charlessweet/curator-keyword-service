Hezbollah Leader Scoffs At The “Idiot” In The White House

When there is weakness – even perceived weakness – in our government, our enemies will test us.

We saw that during the Obama years, simply because he didn’t really care to promote a strong image to the world.

Then we got Trump, and it was a whole new kind of weakness.

At least, that’s what the leader of Hezbollah sees.

Hezbollah is Lebanon’s Shiite militant group, designated by the United States as a terrorist organization.

Hezbollah’s leader had a strong statement about the new president.

 “We are very optimistic that when an idiot settles in the White House and boasts about his idiocy, this is the beginning of relief for the oppressed around the world,” Hezbollah’s Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech Sunday, the Associated Press reports.
That’s where diplomacy comes in handy.

Trump’s bluster is conveying ignorance to the rest of the world and it is unlikely that Nasrallah’s opinion is unique to him, alone.

It is very likely that these comments were a response to Michael Flynn, Trump’s national security adviser’s comments about Iran, after Iran tested a ballistic missile.

“The Trump administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity, and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East and place American lives at risk,” Flynn said during a White House press briefing.

“As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice.”
It sounds like they got the notice and then rejected it.

The next few months are going to be a real test for the Trump administration.
