LIBERAL MSM STOOPS TO NEW LOW, USING PERSECUTED SYRIAN CHRISTIANS AS POLITICAL PROPS

This week, a Syrian Christian family was united with its loved ones in New York City after initially being denied entry to the U.S. due to President Donald Trump‚Äôs travel moratorium.

Tuesday morning, mainstream media outlets and liberal social justice organizations reported on the heartfelt family reunion, gleefully and conveniently overlooking the sheer hypocrisy of their past failure to cover the plight of persecuted Christians in the Middle East.


According to CNN, members of the Asali family had been waiting nearly 15 years to join their relatives in America. But when they finally made it to their initial destination of Philadelphia, one day after Trump issued a completely legal executive order temporarily barring immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, the Asalis were sent back to Doha, Qatar.

Sarmad Assali, a U.S. citizen (who spells her surname differently than her Syrian family members), filed a lawsuit with the American Civil Liberties Union in protest. And after a federal judge issued a temporary injunction against Trump‚Äôs executive order, the Asalis were able to return to the United States.

Now, the same media outlets and social justice groups that called Trump‚Äôs executive order a ‚ÄúMuslim ban,‚Äù and lamented the ‚Äúdiscriminatory‚Äù nature of prioritizing persecuted religious minorities, are celebrating these Christian immigrants. Why, exactly, are they doing this now?

Not because they really care about the Asalis, but because the family serves as the perfect way for them to push their anti-Trump agenda.

See? This family got screwed over, too. And they‚Äôre Christians! Not the even anti-Muslim conservative bigots can support Trump now.

‚ÄúThe thrust is, the low influx of persecuted minorities facing genocide was one of the media‚Äôs best-kept secrets during the Obama administration,‚Äù said Conservative Review‚Äôs Nate Madden, who has written extensively on the plight of religious minorities in the Middle East. ‚ÄúNow that Trump has instituted a travel suspension that has provisions for them, they manage to find the compassion button.‚Äù

Indeed, religious leaders like Archbishop Bashar Warda, the Chaldean Catholic archbishop of Erbil in Iraq, have long begged the U.S. government and media to shed light and assist on the deadly struggles their people face.

In an interview with Crux magazine earlier this month, Archbishop Warda shared his thoughts on President Trump‚Äôs highly contested travel moratorium.

‚ÄúChristians and other minorities have been largely ignored by the American government before now, so even if this step had a bumpy start and required clarification, we in Iraq appreciate that an American administration understands that we are here and wants to help the minorities here who have suffered so much,‚Äù Warda said.

‚ÄúI do not understand why some Americans are now upset that the many minority communities that faced a horrible genocide will finally get a degree of priority in some manner,‚Äù he added.

For many Middle Eastern Christians, Trump‚Äôs executive order wasn‚Äôt a punishment imposed by a racist foreign tyrant, but a much-welcomed policy change that, in the long run, would benefit the truly destitute.

But of course, we have yet to hear this perspective from the liberal mainstream media, and we‚Äôre not likely to any time soon.
