When is the last time the United States had a president who not only refused to take a salary during his time in office, but who also could afford to take foreign leaders to one of his 17 golf courses worldwide on his own dime?

President Donald Trump will pay for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's trip to Mar-a-Lago this weekend as a personal gift, the White House said.

“It’s a personal gift — something Trump is doing for the prime minister,” a senior staffer said.

President Trump and Prime Minister Abe are expected to spend the weekend together working on relations in the Asia-Pacific region which includes China and North Korea.  

During a joint press conference on Friday, President Trump described Japan as "an important and steadfast ally."

The two men and their wives left from Washington, D.C. shortly after the meeting.
