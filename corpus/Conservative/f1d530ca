ARMAGEDDON. Legislation Introduced To Reduce EPA Power

Representative Sam Johnson (TX) has had enough of the EPA attempting to insinuate itself into every aspect of American life. Rather than taking the radical route of simply doing away with it, which is how Representative Matt Gaetz would deal with the issue, Johnson proposes shuttering EPA’s most wasteful and intrusive programs… which, oddly enough, comprises most of what that agency does.

Major EPA climate change programs would be eliminated under the measure.

The legislation would also close all of the EPA’s regional offices, halt new regulations on ground-level ozone pollution and require the agency to lease unused property.

“As a fiscal conservative, I believe Washington should be a good steward of taxpayers’ dollars,” Johnson said in a statement.

“Part of being a good steward includes reining in unnecessary spending, holding agencies accountable for ‘waste,’ and getting rid of politicians’ ‘pet projects.’ For example, American taxpayers shouldn’t have to pay for the EPA’s many vacant and underutilized properties that the EPA’s own Inspector General identified as wasteful,” he said.

The legislation is modeled after a report from the Heritage Foundation, which identified the EPA programs as wasteful.
This probably isn’t going anywhere but it doesn’t hurt to have a bill prepared. Who, this time last year, would have thought there would be a President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt?
