As expected the subject of Trump’s executive order limiting the ability of citizens of seven nations that are either hotbeds of terrorism or a state sponsor of terror from entering the United States came up in the joint press conference Trump held with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Via The Hill:

President Trump said Friday he will make a new policy announcement as soon as next week in response to a court ruling blocking his travel ban.

“We’ll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country,” Trump said during a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. “You’ll see something next week.”

Trump declined to say what the action would entail. His comments came after reports indicated the White House is considering drafting a new executive order.
That would be hilarious. What would be even more hilarious is if the a new executive order made it clear that the Administration still considers the original EO to be in effect. And if this same idiot judge and the same idiot appeals court stop this new EO, Trump should continue issuing them with minor changes in provisions.
