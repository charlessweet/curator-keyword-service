Sen. Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs, D-Mass. (F, 18%) campaign for president in 2020 has kicked off. One way that she has been running is to oppose everything President Donald Trump proposes and to toss mud at every Trump nominee to his Cabinet.

Remember, this is the ethically challenged Elizabeth Warren who claimed to be Cherokee Native American so we should not be surprised at her race-baiting of a fellow Senator.

Also, no one should be surprised about Warren‚Äôs apparent lack of understanding of the rules of the Senate, including the fact that she can‚Äôt take to the Senate floor to attack a fellow senator.

Yesterday, Sen. Warren was called to order by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. (F, 40%) when she violated the Senate‚Äôs rules.

The New York Daily News describes the incident as follows:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell resorted to a rarely-used Senate code to stop Sen. Elizabeth Warren from using the words of Dr. Martin Luther King's widow to question Trump's pick for U.S. Attorney General.

The jarring rebuke prevented Warren (D-Mass.) from speaking after¬†reciting Coretta Scott King‚Äôs 30-year-old letter¬†opposing Sen. Jeff Sessions on his failed federal judge nomination.

In the thick of King‚Äôs letter, she was first warned that her prior use of Sen. Edward Kennedy‚Äôs decades-old remarks criticizing Sessions as ‚Äúa disgrace to the Justice Department" had violated an arcane Senate bylaw that prohibits lawmakers from disparaging a colleague‚Äôs integrity on the floor.

She was interrupted again, this time by McConnell (R-Ky.), while quoting a piece on sexual violence and slapped with a violation for "impugning the motives and conduct" of Sessions

Calling another senator a ‚Äúdisgrace‚Äù and using a letter to imply that Sessions was racially motivated when he worked on a voting case clearly violates the rules of the Senate. A United States senator is supposed to debate the issues and keep the debate above personal attacks on other members. Warren used her whole long speech as one long argument that Sessions harbors racial bias against African-Americans and Muslims.

In fact, Warren‚Äôs entire speech was a long winded screed. She used press releases from Sen. Session‚Äôs, R-Ala. (C, 78%) office used them to attack, attack and attack. She frequently mentioned former Sessions‚Äô staffer Steven Miller and Miller‚Äôs writings to attack Sessions‚Äô qualifications to be the next attorney general.

During her speech, Sen. Warren attacked both Senators Shelby, R-Ala. (D, 68%) and Sessions for sending out a press release with ‚Äúominous intonations about refugees and Muslims.‚Äù Warren also criticized ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs crackdown on Muslims and refugees‚Äù as a way to attack Sessions, because many former Sessions staffers work for President Trump. Although the media is calling the violation of Rule XIX a ‚Äúsilencing‚Äù of Sen. Warren, the truth of the matter is that her speech was one long personal attack on a colleague.

Rule XIX of the Senate‚Äôs rules states:

2. No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.
Thomas Jefferson‚Äôs Manual of Parliamentary Practice first published in 1801 is the origination of this rule in the Senate, in which he wrote:

No person in speaking, is to mention a member then present by his name; but to describe him by his seat in the house, or who spoke last, or on the other side of a question, nor digress from the matter to fall upon the person by speaking, reviling, nipping, or unmannerly words against a particular member.

According to Senator Mitch McConnell, Sen. Warren was warned repeatedly that she could not attack a sitting member of the Senate, yet she continued to do it. During the debate over whether Warren violated the rules, Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho (C, 76%) argued that:

the rules are very clear, you don‚Äôt impugn another Senator. You can‚Äôt do that in your words and you can‚Äôt do it with writings. You can‚Äôt hold up a writing that impugns another Senator and say ‚Äòthis is what somebody else said‚Äô and say that is ok. It is not ok. It is a violation of the rules.

The problem, of course, is that Warren used King‚Äôs writing to imply that her fellow Senator Jeff Sessions is a racist. Not an attack on his qualifications, but a critique at his personal integrity.

MSNBC‚Äôs Rachel Maddow made the absurd argument on her show last night that somehow Mitch McConnell was inserting race into the debate as a way to help Sessions. Others are making the claim that McConnell‚Äôs move was sexism designed to ‚Äúsilence‚Äù Warren.

But the fact of the matter is that the senator from Massachusetts violated the rules.

This may be a real help to Senator Fauxcahontas' quest to be the first self-identified Native American in the White House, but her antics have caused further partisanship in the Senate and she has dragged the debate down into the mud.
