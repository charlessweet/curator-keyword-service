Ajit Pai is already making a splash in his new position of FCC Commissioner, closing the books on a year-long investigation into ‚Äúzero rating,‚Äù the practice by which some companies offer certain types of data to consumers for free. Some internet providers, like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile, exempt some data from user data caps, to encourage certain kinds of activities.

It has been argued that zero rating is anti-competitive and should be outlawed, but Pai rightly observes that the FCC should no longer "focus on denying Americans free data.‚Äù

That should not be a controversial point, but it‚Äôs been met with a surprising amount of resistance. The argument is essentially that allowing companies to offer free data at will gives an unfair advantage to incumbents and makes life harder for upstart, would-be competitors.

Meet the man who‚Äôs going to make America‚Äôs internet free again
This is a familiar line of argument, and it reminds me of the classic antitrust case against Microsoft, in which it was alleged that including Internet Explorer free with the Windows operating system was unfair to the companies trying to sell competing web browsers, such as Netscape Navigator.

That‚Äôs right. Then, as now, the fearsome might of government was wielded against companies giving free stuff to consumers. Why is giving freebies to paying customers a bad thing? The confused line of logic that condemns the practice mistakenly regards competition as an end in itself. In fact, competition is a method to best serve consumer demand. If consumers are happy with the products available to them, interfering in markets to promote additional competition is superfluous at best, and at worst an artificial way to prop up companies that are unable to succeed on their own.

This is one of the problems with net neutrality. In demanding absolute equality of data treatment, net neutrality forbids even actions that benefit consumers. The egalitarian instinct, as Margaret Thatcher observed, ‚Äúwould rather the poor were poorer, provided that the less were less rich.‚Äù

Those who urge government action to make things 'fair' are not interested in improving people‚Äôs lives or increasing the standard of living.

The persistent objection to free products for consumers requires a more thorough explanation.

In ‚ÄúThe Anti-Capitalist Mentality,‚Äù Ludwig von Mises ascribes the main thrust of the opposition to capitalism to resentment and envy. Of capitalism‚Äôs detractors, he says, ‚ÄúThey loathe capitalism because it has assigned to this other man the position they themselves would like to have.‚Äù

But there is a distinction between wanting what other people have and simply wanting them not to have it.

German sociologist Helmut Schoeck discusses this phenomenon at length in his authoritative study ‚ÄúEnvy: A Theory of Social Behavior‚Äù:

[T]he envier has little interest in the transfer of anything of value from the other‚Äôs possession to his own. He would like to see the other person robbed, dispossessed, stripped, humiliated or hurt[.]
In short, those who urge government action to make things ‚Äúfair‚Äù are not interested in improving people‚Äôs lives or increasing the standard of living. They‚Äôre interested in taking other people‚Äôs things away out of spite and malice.

To the extent that government does anything, it should be focused on providing an atmosphere where prosperity can flourish, not the invidious cutting down ‚Äî by hatchet, axe, and saw ‚Äî of those who have what others covet.
