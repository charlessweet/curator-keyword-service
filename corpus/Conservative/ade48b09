Call it “Battle of the Billionaires,” or something.

I don’t know if this is for show, or if this is rich guy rivalry, run amok, but Donald Trump and Mark Cuban can’t seem to leave each other alone.

The New York Post ran an article about Cuban this morning, citing him as someone who could pull votes from both Republicans and Democrats, if he decided to run for office in 2020. The White House may already be looking at him as a potential opponent, as well.

Said Cuban, in an interview with the Star-Telegram last week:

“You want to make nice with the president because you’re a public company and you have shareholders,” he said, “and it’s hard to balance doing the right financial thing versus doing what they think is the right thing, whatever your political beliefs are. It’s not an easy position to be in.’’

He said he would recommend that CEOs “do what you think is right.”

“Be an American citizen first,” he said.
Cuban also slammed Trump on the execution of the travel ban, which he called a “horrible misstep.”

He hit at Trump with this:

 “It was half-baked, it wasn’t thought out, it was rushed, and it was ridiculous. When something like this happens, it calls into question the management skills of the guy in charge,” Cuban said during an interview on CNN.
He’s not wrong, actually. Trump just doesn’t know what he’s doing and the execution of that executive order really showed his inexperience.

Is it an area where he can get better?

Sure it is, if he’s willing to put his ego aside and listen to the people around him.

Trump apparently has a subscription to the New York Post and wants to start campaigning for 2020 the same way he did in 2016… through insults and petty tweets, however.


Right, Mr. Trump, because Mark Cuban is the biggest problem our nation is facing, right now. Glad to see you’re on the job.
