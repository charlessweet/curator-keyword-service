Iranians made their voices heard on Friday, rejecting the United States and newly elected President Donald Trump.

During the celebration of the nation's 1979 Islamic Revolution, thousands of Iranian citizens gathered to burn flags and denounce anything American.


Banners reading “Death to America” and effigies of President Trump were made hanging from ropes.



The crowd burned and trampled over U.S. and Israeli flags.  



Pictures of President Trump, British Prime Minister Theresa May, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were labeled "Death to the Devil Triangle". 

"Some inexperienced figures in the region and America are threatening Iran... They should know that the language of threats has never worked with Iran," President Hassan Rouhani told his people.

"America and Trump cannot do a damn thing. We are ready to sacrifice our lives for our leader [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]," an Iranian man told state television.
