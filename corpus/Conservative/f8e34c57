ELIZABETH WARREN ‚ÄòPERSISTS‚Äô IN SLANDERING JEFF SESSIONS AND THE LEFT HAILS HER A CIVIL RIGHTS HERO! NO, REALLY.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. (F, 18%) is no hero.

In case you missed the parliamentary drama in the U.S. Senate Tuesday night, here‚Äôs a brief recap. Giving remarks on the Senate floor in opposition to the attorney general nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. (C, 78%), Sen. Warren disparaged her colleague with past accusations of racist conduct.

"He made derogatory and racist comments that should have no place in our justice system," Warren said. "To put Sen. Sessions in charge of the Department of Justice is an insult to African Americans."

She went on to call Sen. Sessions a ‚Äúdisgrace‚Äù to the Justice Department.

Now, Jeff Sessions is not a racist, and Warren‚Äôs comments were out of line. For impugning the integrity of a fellow senator, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. (F, 40%) invoked the rules of the Senate to censure Warren and prohibit her from speaking for the remainder of the nomination debate.

Warren took to social media to declare she was ‚Äúsilenced.‚Äù


And she continued to smear President Trump‚Äôs A.G. nominee.


In response to the night‚Äôs events, #LetLizSpeak, #ShePersists, and ‚ÄúSilencing Elizabeth Warren‚Äù were all trending on Twitter, as the Left is rallying to the cause of slandering Jeff Sessions¬†and accusing the Trump administration of running a fascist dictatorship.¬†


As boringly predictable as ever, the GOP is being labeled anti-woman, sexist, racist, etc.


Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren is apparently a civil rights hero.


No, she‚Äôs more than that, she‚Äôs an abolitionist.


Never mind that Jeff Sessions is a man who prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan and worked to desegregate Alabama schools. The woman who lied about her race to help get a job at Harvard is the civil rights hero.¬†


Better haiku:

Don‚Äôt slander Sessions

Elizabeth Warren lied

Your tweets are stupid

But the Democrats know that. They aren‚Äôt opposing Jeff Sessions because of alleged racist remarks or conduct. They know Jeff Sessions is not a bigot; they fear Jeff Sessions because he is a conservative and because he will enforce the law.
