The United States Senate confirmed Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education Tuesday after Vice-President Mike Pence broke a 50-50 tie in the affirmative.

Liberals on Twitter are losing their freaking minds, starting with the Democratic minority leader, who is arguing that the Cabinet process was rigged because the Vice-President followed the Constitution and broke a tie.


You hear that? Rigged!


How rigged? So rigged that this nominee in a Republican administration, who is a Republican, has previously donated to Republicans. But forget how she got appointed, what is she going to do as Secretary of Education?


Sell public school system infrastructure. Okay ‚Ä¶


Because supporting school choice to give kids more opportunities makes them unequal. Clearly.


The children!


Malaria? Smallpox? Polio? Leukemia? Post-2000 Cartoon Network?


No joke necessary. The stupidity of that tweet speaks volumes.


‚ÄúTotal rejection of education.‚Äù That‚Äôs how liberals view school choice.


‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt forget!‚Äù says man 98% of America could not identify in a lineup. Also, you misspelled "the." Clearly our public education system has failed you.¬†


Is she referring to the Democratic efforts to stop President Trump‚Äôs cabinet picks? Because yes, #HoldTheFloor was an epic fail.


Shadow schools folks. They're coming back in style.

It's funny how Republicans cried over Michelle Obama and school lunches but could care less about Betsy DeVos ruining our education.

How is she ruining our education?¬†


Holy crap. Betsy DeVos hasn‚Äôt been on the job a single day and she‚Äôs already convincing liberals it's better to let parents have more control over their education.

Well, my future kids will be home-schooled forever. Betsy Devos is basically a paper mache doll becoming Secretary of Education.

‚Äî RAS (@rasofficial) February 7, 2017

THEY‚ÄôRE SUPPORTING HOMESCHOOLING! Betsy DeVos just became the single best thing to happen to education in decades.


Well, they can‚Äôt be dumber than these tweets.
