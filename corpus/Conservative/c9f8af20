Immigration Supporters Take To The Streets To Protest Immigration Enforcement Raids

Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York, and several other cities around the nation were targeted for ICE raids over the last couple of days, and it has pro-immigration activists in a tizzy.

On Friday night, protesters gathered in New York City, angered by the raids that have netted hundreds of illegals, this week.

ICE said that 160 people have been arrested. But the agency maintained that it’s not a sign of new policy.

“While this week’s operation was an enforcement surge, the focus was no different than the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE’s Fugitive Operations Teams on a daily basis,” a spokeswoman said.
So this wasn’t a Trump directive, but just business as usual.

Seriously, they make it hard to try and see their side when just the very blunt way to put this is that if you know you’re somewhere breaking the law, maybe don’t draw attention to yourself by being obnoxious and demanding rights that aren’t afforded to you, as somebody who is breaking the law to be here.

Notice the ready-made professional signs?
