MLK Jr's Niece: Elizabeth Warren Played the Race Card Against Sessions

Alveda King, niece of Martin Luther King Jr., did not approve of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) invoking her aunt's name to smear Jeff Sessions. Warren was silenced Tuesday night on the Senate floor during the vote to confirm Jeff Sessions as attorney general. In her crusade against Sessions, Warren pulled out all the racist charges she could think of. At one point, Warren tried to read a letter Coretta Scott King once penned to object to Sessions' nomination to a federal judgeship in the 1980s. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell informed her she was breaking Senate rules and effectively cut off her mic. Of course, she and her liberal supporters only used that as momentum.

King, however, saw right through Warren's crusade. In an appearance on Fox News' "Your World With Neil Cavuto," she shamed the Massachusetts senator for daring to invoke her family's name to bring down a decent man.

“So it’s almost like a bait and switch, stir up their emotions, use the name King — and my name is Alveda King — stir up people’s emotions [and] play the race card, which she was attempting to do,” King said.

King, who knows her aunt much better than Warren, mused that she would have given Sessions credit for the efforts he made in regards to civil rights. Perhaps most notably, Sessions helped secure the death penalty for a KKK leader in Alabama. 

“Aunt Coretta was a very reasonable women and she, with integrity, would have noted that he had done some great work in fighting against discrimination,” she explained.

She repeated her remarks in an appearance on "Fox & Friends."


Despite Warren's antics, Sessions was confirmed, sworn in, and has already shaken hands with his Justice Department staff.
