Chuck Schumer speaks the truth on labor secretary nominee and fast food CEO Andy Puzder, though at this point Donald Trump’s amazing gall and hypocrisy have been exposed so thoroughly that no one can really claim to be surprised:

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (N.Y.) on Thursday called Puzder “probably the most anti-worker nominee to the Department of Labor ever.”

“Donald Trump campaigned on behalf of the working men and women,” Schumer said. “He said he was going to represent them. The nomination of Mr. Puzder represents broken promise after broken promise. Donald Trump has amazing gall, to have campaigned the way he did, and then put this man as nominee for secretary of Labor.

“They ought to withdraw the nomination of Puzder before he further embarrasses this administration and further exposes the hypocrisy of President Trump, saying one thing to the workers of America, and then doing another,” he added.
To recap: Puzder’s chains, Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr., specialize in wage theft—making workers work off the clock, denying them overtime pay, making them pay for uniforms that push them below minimum wage—and also face sexual harassment complaints. Puzder’s company sent jobs overseas. Puzder once personally contributed $10,000 to block a $1 minimum wage increase. He loves to run ads featuring bikini-clad women eating hamburgers, because hot babes in bikinis amirite? He employed an undocumented housekeeper, fired her when he found out she was undocumented, but only paid taxes on her employment after he was nominated for labor secretary. As Noam Scheiber points out, “If he thought she was legal, why didn't he pay taxes all along?”

Sen. Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, joined Schumer in hitting hard on Puzder’s nomination:

“It is shocking that a nominee for this critical position would flout those rules so openly, overlooking the same responsibilities that business owners nationwide manage to uphold,” she said, adding that Puzder’s “decision to pick and choose what laws he himself follows is disqualifying.”
Puzder’s spokesman dismissed Schumer and Murray’s concerns as “fake news,” in keeping with the official Trump regime definition of fake news as “news I don’t like but have no strong rebuttal to.”

Appointing Puzder as labor secretary reveals Donald Trump’s desire for a “fast food” service economy for the USA and not a resurgence in manufacturing as he claims.

Read somewhere this  morning that Pudzer bragged a few years ago that 40% of his workforce was  undocumented.  That should be disqualifying to REPUBLICANS!  I hope Dems make the most of it.

They won’t unless we force them.  The massive demonstrations help but in the end only massive voting matters.  We Democrats are really, really bad at voting...

Democrats can’t win the Cabinet game, but they can set a solid foundation regarding the most corrupt Administration in decades.  I’m pretty sick of the “spine” “backbone” comments here.  The Dems have been fighting hard.  You want a spine and a backbone — fucking run for office.  There’s still only two here I’ve seen — Charles Gaba and Angela Marx.  Put your fucking spines where your keyboards are if you think the Democrats can do more.

Agreed, 100%  I’ve not forgetten the endless calls for Obama to grow a spine.  The same folks are doing it again—predictably blaming Dems for every single thing *45 and his posse of deplorables does.  I guess there’s nothing easier than flinging around criticism and demands. Feh.

They are still slowing it down and forcing some errors along the way.  They are draining GOP energy that would otherwise be dedicated to repeal of domestic issues.  So far they have stalled out on ACA and have to re-group.  I believe Trump’s tax package is coming up next week which will cause chaos among their ranks.  All we can do is obstruct and force them to make mistakes and not get to things they would like to.  It’s only 22 months until the next election.

I fully expect people will take to the streets as they realize that the institutions that protect them are being dismantled. Trump sees a bifurcated America, one for “citizens,” and one for rabble. And this will affect all spheres of life, from economic opportunity and education the health and pay scales. It really is a reactionary government, and I certainly have never seen such a thing.

I agree.  I think that in the end we will have to resort to torches and ropes — to threats of violent uprising — to stop this march toward fascism. 

It may cost lives.  As a veteran I offered mine to protect my country. That offer stands.  If it comes to that I’ll be carrying a rope.

I love this cabinet! We have a SoS who's in bed with Russia. We have an AG who opposes civil rights. The head of the EPA wants to destroy the environment. The Sec of Education hates public schools. Now we're going to have a Labor Secretary with a documented history of abusing workers.

You can't make this sh!t up.

I personally met Mr. Puzder in a professional capacity several years ago.   I have rarely encountered a corporate executive with such strong opinions on rolling back worker’s rights and eliminating California state labor entitlements as Mr. Puzder — and he was more than happy to tell me all about it without me even asking.

It is also worth noting that Mr. Puzder rose to the CEO position at CKE Restaurants after he helped the company founder (arch-conservative billionaire Carl Karcher) to fight off an insider trading charge — Puzder was the company’s general counsel before he became CEO.

I hope the Senate Democrats are thoroughly investigating  these issues — they go much deeper than Tom Price trading in some medical device stocks.

No one wants to protest for nothing. It is vital that we document what protests actually accomplished, from Forcing Pence to exercise his Trump-card with DeVos (getting a lot of press), to forcing a proposal to be withdrawn. It is ABSOLUTELY VITAL that we continue and multiply our protests. Boycott products and get your butt to a town hall meeting some in the next few days. Numbers count.

Trump and his ilk believe that workers are the modern day equivalent to the feudal serf, they believe the lord and master deserves all the wealth and that he is being generous by offering not to “date” any of the serf’s 8 to 10 year old daughters till they are older….

Schumer had a good piece in the NYT today about Gorsuch:

And one of the commenters had a good question:

Andrew
Louisville 7 hours ago

I think one simple question which is not directly related to any current or potential case before the court. "What would be your advice to the President if a SCOTUS vacancy arises in (say) the last year of the term?"
One could argue that we are already in Trump’s last year of his term.

Ergo, no go, Mitch.

Working off the clock is thoroughly illegal; another name for it is  “slavery”. 

This doesn’t bother Herr Drumpf, of course.  He has never worked on or off the clock in his privileged life.   So it makes sense that he would appoint a slaver to be Secretary of Labor.

We “little people”, you see, deserve no better.

It is difficult to decide which of Trump’s cabinet nominees is the most vile and corrupt, but I’d definitely say Puzder is solidly one of the top 3.

At least when you rub salt into wounds it helps them heal.  This is more like rubbing workers noses in Trump turds.   Buy Ivanka’s over priced made overseas junk, support American workers.

His entire Cabinet of Deplorables should have been thrown out, and he should have started over with people who knew what they were doing. And your diary makes great points, but it’s really hard to figure which of these people are worse, which ones would screw over the American public more, and which ones would be the first to destroy the agencies in their charge. 

I really will never understand any of these people. It’s like they lived on another planet, one with just incredibly rich people, and were plunked down in the good old USA without a clue as to what our people need, what our history is, and what the government is supposed to accomplish. Then they were given these jobs. One wonders why they even want to bother. Would they really get that much of a thrill destroying what the people have built for the past couple of hundred years and putting lots of government workers, along with many private-sector workers for that matter, on unemployment? Why?
