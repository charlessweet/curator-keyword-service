I know similar comments have been posted before, but this is the most comprehensive list I’ve seen:

A Trump supporting Facebook friend told Scott Mednick, "We suffered for eight years. Now it’s your turn.”
Scott wrote a brilliant response asking how exactly his friend had suffered under Obama:
"I am surprised you would wish suffering upon me. That of course is your right, I suppose. I do not wish harm on anyone. Your statement seems to continue the ‘US v THEM’ mentality. The election is over. It is important to get past campaigning and campaign rhetoric and get down to what is uniting, not dividing and what is best for 
ALL Americans.
There will never be a President who does everything to everyone’s liking. There are things President Obama (and President Clinton) did that I do not like and conversely there are things I can point to that the Presidents Bush did that I agree with. So I am not 100% in lock step with the outgoing President but have supported him and the overall job he did.
And, if you recall, during the Presidential Campaign back in 2008 the campaign was halted because of the "historic crisis in our financial system." Wall Street bailout negotiations intervened in the election process. The very sobering reality was that there likely could be a Depression and the world financial markets could collapse. The United States was losing 800,000 jobs a month and was poised to lose at least 10 million jobs the first year once the new President took office. We were in an economic free-fall. So let us recall that ALL of America was suffering terribly at the beginning of 
Obama’s Presidency.
But I wanted to look back over the last 8 years and ask you a few questions. Since much of the rhetoric before Obama was elected was that he would impose Sharia Law, Take Away Your Guns, Create Death Panels, Destroy the Economy, Impose Socialism and, since you will agree that NONE of this came to pass,
I was wondering:
Why have you suffered so?
So let me ask:
Gays and Lesbians can now marry and enjoy the benefits they had been deprived of. Has this caused your suffering?
When Obama took office, the Dow was 6,626. Now it is 19,875. Has this caused your suffering?
We had 82 straight months of private sector job growth - the longest streak in the history of the United States. Has this caused 
your suffering?
Especially considering where he the economy was when he took over, an amazing 11.3 million new jobs were created under President Obama (far more than President Bush). Has this caused 
your suffering?
Obama has taken Unemployment from 10% down to 4.7%. Has this caused your suffering?
Homelessness among US Veterans has dropped by half. Has this caused your suffering?
Obama shut down the US secret overseas prisons. Has this caused your suffering?
President Obama has created a policy for the families of fallen soldiers to have their travel paid for to be there when remains are flown home. Has this caused your suffering?
We landed a rover on Mars. Has this caused your suffering?
He passed the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Has this caused your suffering?
Uninsured adults has decreased to below 10%: 90% of adults are insured - an increase of 20 Million Adults. Has this caused
your suffering?
People are now covered for pre-existing conditions. Has this caused your suffering?
Insurance Premiums increased an average of $4,677 from 2002-2008, an increase of 58% under Bush. The growth of these
insurance premiums has gone up $4,145 – a slower rate of increase. Has this caused your suffering?
Obama added Billions of dollars to mental health care for our Veterans. Has this caused your suffering?
Consumer confidence has gone from 37.7 to 98.1 during Obama’s tenure. Has this caused your suffering?
He passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Has this caused 
your suffering?
His bi-annual Nuclear Summit convinced 16 countries to give up and destroy all their loose nuclear material so it could not be stolen. Has this caused your suffering?
He saved the US Auto industry. American cars sold at the beginning of his term were 10.4M and upon his exit 17.5M. Has this caused your suffering?
The deficit as a percentage of the GDP has gone from 9.8% to 3.2%. Has this caused your suffering?
The deficit itself was cut by $800 Billion Dollars. Has this caused 
your suffering?
Obama preserved the middle class tax cuts. Has this caused 
your suffering?
Obama banned solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons. Has this caused your suffering?
He signed Credit Card reform so that rates could not be raised without you being notified. Has this caused your suffering?
He outlawed Government contractors from discriminating against LGBT persons. Has this caused your suffering?
He doubled Pell Grants. Has this caused your suffering?
Abortion is down. Has this caused your suffering?
Violent crime is down. Has this caused your suffering?
He overturned the scientific ban on stem cell research. Has this caused your suffering?
He protected Net Neutrality. Has this caused your suffering?
Obamacare has extended the life of the Medicare insurance trust fund (will be solvent until 2030). Has this caused your suffering?
President Obama repealed Don't Ask Don't Tell. Has this caused 
your suffering?
He banned torture. Has this caused your suffering?
He negotiated with Syria to give up its chemical weapons and they were destroyed. Has this caused your suffering?
Solar and Wind Power are at an all time high. Has this caused 
your suffering?
High School Graduation rates hit 83% - an all time high. Has this caused your suffering?
Corporate profits are up by 144%. Has this caused your suffering?
He normalized relations with Cuba. Has this caused your suffering?
Reliance on foreign oil is at a 40 year low. Has this caused your suffering?
US Exports are up 28%. Has this caused your suffering?
He appointed the most diverse cabinet ever. Has this caused 
your suffering?
He reduced the number of troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Has this caused your suffering?
Yes, he killed Osama Bin Laden and retrieved all the documents in his possession for analysis. Perhaps THIS caused your suffering?
From an objective standpoint it would appear that the last eight years have seen some great progress and we were saved from a financial collapse. Things are not perfect. Things can always be better. We are on much better footing now than we were in 2008.
I look forward to understanding what caused you to suffer so much under Obama these last eight years."
Copy & paste to share. I hope you will.
At least we were on better footing.  Looking pretty slippery now.

Yep.  I have a friend who tells me he had to “endure 8 years of Obama”.  It was always “Obama is a Muslim and is coming to take our guns”. The usual horseshit.  I blame that attitude on believing everything the right wing noise machine spews out.

I think another part of the equation is their perception of “reverse discrimination” where they feel that by having a black president that somehow good white folks are being discriminated against. Of course, these same people will no doubt sing the praises of Trump while he and the Republicans fuck them. To those people I say - be careful what you wish for.

They feel it is a zero sum game. If anything gets better for anyone else, they believe it MUST get worse for them whether they can point to any suffering or not. The right wing has been full of stories of free money for black people only, free houses and cars. Thousands of idiot paranoids on the right actually believe Obama has been taking tangible goods from them and giving them to black people.

When Obama was in office, they weren’t able to be open about their racism.

Seeing a smart, capable, classy black man in a position of power, who was humble and gracious in the application of that power — that made all of them suffer from cognitive dissonance.  Knowing that their views were not widely accepted made them suffer, and it was an effort to maintain a thin veneer of civility over their malignant beliefs.

THAT was the horrible burden that Obama made them carry for 8 years.

grumpynerd  Decorina Feb 11 · 02:57:41 PM
It’s always interesting to disaggregate statistics, and when you do that you see a big metro (cities and suburbs) / non-metro (rural and small town) split.   Urban areas have made up the job losses from the great recession, non-metro areas have never returned to their pre-Great Recession levels, and non-metro unemployment rate has only dropped because the participation rate has dropped.

But the thing is, you can’t point to an Obama policy that hurt people in those rural areas, other than his pro-fracking stance which certainly hurt coal miners.  But take Republican policies, such as refusing to accept Medicaid expansion; this was a deliberate attempt to damage Obama’s reputation by inflicting unnecessary pain on voters.

They tell me that their health insurance costs increased significantly and that Obama was weak about Syria and Israel and that he favors Muslims over Israel, over Christians. I just read, in fact, that Obama’s Justice Department fought more anti-Mosque land use cases than anything about Christians and that Jeff Sessions could change that.  They will ask for proof of all of the assertions about the good Obama did. They may disregard news sources they don’t know to be reliable.

After oh… 30 odd years or so of being told by Rush, Fox News, etc. that “Liberals are bad!” — and “Democrat” is synonymous with “liberal”, THAT’S how the person “suffered”. Sure, Obama was black (which didn’t “help”) but they would be skewering Hillary right now if she’d won, too.

A rather large cross-section of the population has been taught to simply hate us and scapegoat all of their problems on us. This, imho, is why they repeatedly vote against their own self-interests. You have to hand it to Republicans — they’ve been *very* effective at this.

They were screaming and howling to repeal Obamacare until they realized that maybe… just maybe… they’d be f***ed without it. And that’s just one example.

Perhaps slogging through 4 years of our current Moron In Chief will give them pause… but I won’t hold my breath on that.

Many of the trumpsters will throw back that all of those facts are lies or fake news.  Recall, in the Trump era, there are no facts, at least not for trumpsters.  He will claim that unemployment is nearly 50 % and they’ll believe him.  He will claim that crime is worse than it’s been for nearly 50 years and they’ll believe him.  These are not people who are receptive to facts.  They will claim to have uniquely suffered no matter how much reliable data you give them.

I have some well-to-do relatives who are trump zealots, and while Obama was president they ranted about how “he's the worst president ever” and “he better be impeached before he cancels the elections and declares martial law.” None of the horrible conspiracies they feared under the Obama administration came to pass. They all live very well in grand homes, with expensive cars, vacations, etc. Yet they claimed to have suffered during his presidency? Why? Gays getting married! Women killing babies! Sharia law! Black man in the White House!

That Facebook post was brilliant. If I thought my relatives capable of listening to reason, I'd send it to them. But they're too busy waiting for the Rapture.

A: Well, not true, but even if so, Lyin’ Ted Cruz passed muster with the judges to run, and his situation born in Canada to one American citizen is pretty much the same as their Obama accusation.

Benghazhi.

A: Terrorist attacks happen on all President’s watches. Benghazhi — 4 people, though any are unfortunate.  9/11 — thousands, and they were warned.  Bin Laden — escaped bush, not Obama.

Lied about keeping your doctor if you want to in ACA.

A: How much of this was due to doctors deciding not to participate rather than patients being kicked out? I actually don’t know this for sure, but the design was intended to allow you to keep your doctor, in my somewhat limited understanding.

He’s a dictator who signs all these EO’s like a tyrant.

A: After years of obstruction and explicit statements of non-cooperation and wanting to end him after his first term, he had few options left after trying hard to be bipartisan. Now look what’s happening with these under the new guy, and they’re mostly not even legally or well written.

He’ll take away your guns and cancel elections.

Might I suggest that you talk to them with a concerned, serious, straight face about how the family should run the numbers and calculate if the money will run out when Social Security and Medicare and Affordable Care Act provisions go away. And make a pact about who will take care of whom in case of incapacitating illness or injury or dementia and long life. For example, a premature baby’s LIFETIME cap on health insurance can be used up by the age of 2 if current provisions are repealed. Also ask them, without snark, if their wealth is secure….now that laws are not mandating that their interests must come first—no more fiduciary responsibility by financial advisors.

You hit the nail right on the head, Gary.  Liberals will congratulate themselves for taking the time to assemble this thorough list of accomplishments but the hard core trumpsters, if they read this post at all, won’t read past the third item or so.  The entire thing will be dismissed as b.s. propaganda.  You’re right.  Stupid won, it was proud and willful stupidity, and that probably can’t be fixed.

The only thing that can fix some people in this camp is if they experience real suffering, recognize the difference between real suffering and imaginary suffering, and manage to summon up as much rage against the perpetrators as they have for liberals.  A lot of things have to fall a certain way there so I’m not optimistic.

They’re likely to experience that suffering too, under Trump. Cuts in health care, benefits, etc. All the things right-wing media told them Obama was destroying. Then once the Republicans do this, they’ll find a way to blame Obama, and their faithful followers will believe them.

Then just watch, Trump will get re-elected in 4 years. I couldn’t believe this country re-elected W., but it did. Trump told his followers he would make America great again, and they would win so much they would get tired of winning. Just like addicted gamblers who keep playing the lottery or visiting casinos clinging to hope that someday they’ll win no matter how many times they lose, they’ll place their bets on Trump again in 4 years.

We all know what they really mean by suffering under Obama. He took away their most precious possession, more precious than their guns, their money, their homes, their cars, their kids—their incandescent light bulbs. No, Obama took away their unearned and unmerited conceit that, merely by being white, conservative and Christian, they were better than everyone else, and more deserving of all the good things in life, including government benefits and services, compared to all those icky black and brown and non-Christian and LGBT and liberal and not very traditionally feminine women. He took that conceit and he trashed it, and they just weren’t going to have it. He shattered their world and he had to be made to pay the price for it. Obama cut them down a peg or ten, and that was literally worse than being raped and thrown out on the street. It was their Vietnam, their Holocaust, their 9/11. Oh the Sean Hannity!

I have one sibling who thinks the MAGAt way but another sibling troubles me more because I think Trump’s message has resonated in his functional bi-polar mind.

Reading some of his FB postings, he will go for hours posting one CT/alt-right link after another.  It’s a Gish Gallop of Fox News, Breitbart and some other sites which I have never heard of and don’t wish to waste any time viewing.  The net of it is that there is some wide-spread ‘globalist’ structure that includes the usual suspects:  Hilary, Soros and any prominent liberal like George Clooney, Pelosi etc.  Globalist seems to be another pejorative like cuck or snowflake that people like him throw around as if it is a valid charge or description of their adversaries.

People like him have their guy in charge — why are they continuing to vent and attack a vanquished opponent and accuse them of ‘pay-for-play’ when the most egregious example — Betsy deVos — is right in front of their faces?  If there are any globalists, I would think the sundry Goldman Sachs and fossil fuel advocates in Trump’s cabinet choices are a more apt group.

Probably?  I’d say ‘most definitely’.  We now know that the GOP was fully aware they might be obstructing things they traditionally believed in, or that would help their constituents.  But because today’s GOP cares more about ‘winning’ than policy—or even country—they’ll obstruct.

I remember, years ago, some televised debate on public television about whether it was a representative’s job to sometimes vote his/her conscience (maybe they had a particular expertise in a certain area?) rather than simply reflect a pro/con tally of constituent opinion.  Democrats struggled with the question and had nuanced responses, but Republicans were just perplexed.  They couldn’t understand the question.  For them, what kind of representative wasn’t there to be a rubber stamp for popular opinion?

And those were the day before anybody had heard of the name Tom DeLay.  

Today we have a president who cannot conceive of such a thing as a principled opposition.  These are people who would’ve been against the notion of ‘democracy’ in 1776 had they been around thinking like this.  Not following orders is tantamount to treason.  Yet, amazingly, they consider themselves ‘patriots’.  Patriots of what, I sometimes wonder.

I have a new strategy when it comes to online Trumpanzee battles , at least. The other day I was in the midst of one such battle, in which the usual talking points were bleated (How can you know he’s mentally ill? You’re not a doctor. We just wanted to change the status quo!). Realizing we were never going to get anywhere, I said, okay, fine, let’s stop this. But I’m going to print out this conversation, just to have a record of it. You won’t mind, right? Since you know you’re right? And while they said it was indeed alright, I returned shortly thereafter to find the conversation erased (too late for them!). I believe it’s important we have a record of this- historically, people who’ve participated in an atrocity try to deny it once the fact it was indeed an atrocity is settled business. We can’t let them do that this time.

Life Expectancy of White Americans down, communities still devastated.  My father would bring signs home from the factory he worked at before it was packed up and sent to China:  “5 atta boys, are erased by one Aw shit”;  “You may have done a GOOD thing, but if you didn’t do the RIGHT thing: YOU FAILED”.

Aside from the Life Expectancy thing, which we were told was seen during the break up of the Soviet Union, and should be a clear indicator of major problems that need to be addressed.  How about Millennials having to rely more heavily on their parents, and looking at a worse economic situation than the generation before them, despite being more highly educated.

How about President Obama coming into office when people needed work, and needing an economic stimulus, and we still ended up with Flint Michigan,  the too small, too heavily tax cut, and treading water with unemployment, didn’t even do the 2 trillion in repairs we were behind on roads and bridges, it certainly didn’t replace the aging pipes, update our electrical grid ect. 

I loved Obama, but he failed in many ways, and that resulted in real suffering for many Americans, if he didn’t create the situation, he did nothing to stop it.   Many places haven’t returned to 2006 per capita income highs in the 10 years since, when they are also places $5,000 less than the national average….  But nationally we have been below peak the entire Obama Presidency,  and with growing economic inequality...

What would you be refuting?

The per capita income is in the $16,000 range, it has stayed the same for the last 16 years, the major industry is manufacturing, do you think a President that was doing Trade Deals like Obama, vs a President hostile to trade Deals like Trump  might alleviate some economic anxiety (suffering) from people that want to hold onto the per capita income that is less than 1/3 the national average.

All I am saying is show some empathy and understanding don’t tell them they are wrong.  Yeah they will end up suffering as much or more under Trump than they did under Obama, they have been fooled, but the posted response isn’t a way to convince them, it is to make us feel better, and that is what is not helping.

Actually, that probably did contribute to it, since it was probably at our expense.

He wasn't the only one who was responsible for running the country. Elected officials at every level bare this responsibility. You cancredit them for these failures.

You are right, but it has always been the President that gets the blame.  Bush didn’t repeal Glass-Steagall which led to the financial crash, but he was blamed for it.   And one huge difference between the Federal government, and other levels of government, the ability to run deficits, a depressed area will never have the money to invest to turn themselves around without outside help.

And Obama didn’t even seem to be trying to engage the fight, the stimulus was with Democrats in control of Congress, the majority of the areas that need help are Republican controlled, Obama could have gone and make a direct case on what he was trying to do to help them that was being prevented by Conservatives.  I blame Obama for not fighting, and not communicating what was preventing the help to be delivered.  He should have been hammering FDR’s economic Bill of Rights  his entire Presidency.

President Obama wasn’t white (reverse and vulgarize that statement for the true effect I want to convey to you). Racists are stupid and irredeemable. I have several in my family. Self-interest goes out the window when skin color darkens or accents become unfamiliar. It’s a disease, not a political position and when it becomes one, things go to hell fast.

What Pisses Them Of about Obama

is that as president he pursued a diplomatic course that accommodated the reality of globalism.

Populists are all about “me” being good and “other” being bad, and thus feared.

Obama was other by means of color alone and being the first person of color to become president, which was more than enough for them.

Trump is a very white Amurrica-firster who hates and fears what they hate and fear.  I only hope they love and embrace, as much as he does, ex-KGB Putin and the Russians.  Although, how they can accommodate that necessity to Agent Orange’s political baggage boggles my mind.

Here are some counterpoints: (note : I am not a trump supporter) On why/how the middle class suffered under Obama:

1. Obama never prosecuted any banker — and bad foreclosures continued while he was president (see: closurefraud.org ) 

2. Obama continued the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ( I worked an election polling place — I had one military enlisted man say to me: “It doesn’t matter who I vote for they both want to sent me to fight and die” )

3. Obama continued to increase the surveillance state (ask Snowden) that is now available to Trump to use.

4. Obama had to be fought to get basic environmental protections in place ( the Keystone Pipeline dragged on long enough that Trump has a chance at reviving it )

5. Obama bailed out the auto industry — but he did little to help the rest of the manufacturing industry come back.

6. Obama did not build up the grassroots so they could defend and increase the positive message. ( state house losses and governorship losses increased while Obama was president ) 

7. Obama had a message driven campaign that he did not deliver in visible ways on. He encouraged a data centric approach to campaigning with in the Democratic party. He let the national party atrophy and move away from the 50state Howard Dean approach.

8. Obama ignored the state Democratic parties and allowed the republicans to sabotage Obamacare and stimulus packages.

9. Obama was an incrementalist when we need a all-in guy, who was every day visibly fighting for the middle class.

10. Obama welcomed the bankers and influencers into the White House (Mary Jo White — SEC) and allowed his enemies more influence than the middle class that rallied to him in 2008. FDR said that he “welcomed the hatred of the bankers” Obama never declared someone the enemy of the middle class the way FDR effectively did. 

11. NAFTA and other “free trade” treaties were horrible for the midwest. TPP was more of the same. Obama kept pushing TPP and did NOT let any one from his BASE have any influence. Instead it was just the corporate elites.

12. Trump is right. (Perot was right first). NAFTA was a bad deal. TPP promised more of the same.

One of the great injustices of the past 50 years (or more?):  That American citizens are being convinced they are victims at the hands of the rest of the world, when their representatives represent interests that use American government to become the world’s greatest predator nation in their name.  From the outside, this development is extremely galling; to hear the richest nation’s citizens exclaiming not just their victimhood, but their intention to ‘hit back’ and extract concessions — or even punish — perceived advantage-takers, through the public power handed to them by a people who cannot see their own taking advantage of them..

In the 1770’s the royalists in charge of the colonies weren’t arguing that the colonists were victims of the Crown, the rebels were.  In the 1790’s the French royalist government weren’t arguing that the bourgeoisie/poor were victims, the rebels were.  

Only in the era of mass communications were governments able to convince citizens of truths that were debatable at best.  First, during WW1 when the home front needed to support the state (and its involvement in war), and then even more effectively in the 1930’s when peacetime politics took on the tone and trappings of wartime urgency.

And now, in the present, society’s leaders are able to manipulate our expectations about certain types of media, within the tsunami of total media and advertising, such that a society can be made to believe in anything…or nothing at all.

Thanks for this.  I’m going to need it soon, as my Klan of Deplorons are just biting at the bit to get me to engage about the Orange Buffoon’s “huuuge, overwhelming mandate” in the election, once, of course, you discount all those millions of illegal votes for Hillary. 🙄�

So now I have ammunition.  Clear. Concise.  If they read it at all, they won’t be able to argue anything.  But it certainly answers all their questions, allegations, suspicions and beliefs with FACTS.  

Although knowing my Klan, after they read the first few lines, they’re gonna recognize that this might be a fact-based litany of positive things about the Obama admin.  And they feel very threatened when any facts get close to their mania.  

But hope spring eternal.  Maybe this list of facts will finally get through to them.  Except that they, like the Donald Duck they adore, will have to admit they were wrong.  And apparently that is never gonna happen. 😕�

Except we already know it doesn’t, it often makes the situation worse.

In the end, truth will out. Won’t it?
Maybe not. Recently, a few political scientists have begun to discover a human tendency deeply discouraging to anyone with faith in the power of information. It’s this: Facts don’t necessarily have the power to change our minds. In fact, quite the opposite. In a series of studies in 2005 and 2006, researchers at the University of Michigan found that when misinformed people, particularly political partisans, were exposed to corrected facts in news stories, they rarely changed their minds. In fact, they often became even more strongly set in their beliefs. Facts, they found, were not curing misinformation. Like an underpowered antibiotic, facts could actually make misinformation even stronger.
And if you harbor the notion — popular on both sides of the aisle — that the solution is more education and a higher level of political sophistication in voters overall, well, that’s a start, but not the solution. A 2006 study by Charles Taber and Milton Lodge at Stony Brook University showed that politically sophisticated thinkers were even less open to new information than less sophisticated types. These people may be factually right about 90 percent of things, but their confidence makes it nearly impossible to correct the 10 percent on which they’re totally wrong. Taber and Lodge found this alarming, because engaged, sophisticated thinkers are “the very folks on whom democratic theory relies most heavily.”

I’m sorry.  I’ve read your response 3 times now, and it seems to me to be a non-sequitur to the points I made.  

I have yet to see any proof of the “damage” that the 90% of the  Progressives, who are intelligent, thoughtful, reasoning and informed,  have inflicted on everyone else with their “10% of confidence that they are not wrong” or whatever that convoluted point was supposed to be.  What is your point?

As I read it the point was that fact based arguments may not be effective, and may actually do the opposite of persuading someone to your point of view. 

Obviously, some links to the assertions would have been helpful. The blockquotes are from a 2010 op ed.

It, and the research it references, were widely discussed at the time, and have been cited often since.

The "backfire effect" is a term coined by Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler to describe how some individuals when confronted with evidence that conflicts with their beliefs come to hold their original position even more strongly

With much fanfare, the Oxford Dictionaries announced that the new word for 2016 was “post-truth.” The Dictionary defines “post-truth” as “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.”

Right Wing radio promotes the us vs them thinking.  I have more reason to cheer our local university’s sports teams, (at least I am an alumni), than the vast majority of  Limbaugh etc.. listeners have to cheer Rs.  They are sold a pile of shit almost exclusively through rage, lies, and calling Democrats names.  That is what we are up against, ask them why they suffered and they will spew lies and call Obama the names they were programmed to call him.  Listen to hate radio long enough and you can no longer think for yourself, and calling a name means “you won”.  Sigh,at least “my team” just won their basketball game I was watching on TV.

I'm sick of all these people. They wanted to take a stick and poke it in the government's eye so they voted Trump. It obviously never occurred to them what day to day life was going to be like with a totally unqualified POTUS at the helm. Maybe they don't care. Apparently all this he tells it like it is, and he's an outsider nonsense is all that matters to these idiots. The rest of us get to live with the consequences of these people's axes to grind and it pissses me off more than I can say. Screw them all.
