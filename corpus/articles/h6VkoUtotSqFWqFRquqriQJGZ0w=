This is disgraceful and embarrassing.  But it’s not surprising.

Washington (CNN) Traditionally, it's the role of the first lady to accompany spouses of visiting foreign leaders around Washington. That often means a good deal of showcasing local museums, schools, monuments and gardens. It's essentially playing tour guide, but it's part of the role of representing the Administration and playing gracious hostess to very VIP out of town guests.
Melania Trump appears to be breaking with this particular tradition.
On two pre-scheduled Washington stops Friday, one to Gallaudet University and the other to attend a National Cherry Blossom Festival committee meeting at the Japanese embassy, the first lady of Japan, Akie Abe, was alone, without Mrs. Trump to guide her.
. . .
But Mrs. Abe's solo DC outings are nothing like her previous trips to the US capital city.
In 2015, Mrs. Abe joined Michelle Obama on a visit to a Great Falls, Virginia, elementary school, where the two women were cheered by students.
. . .
(In 2007, Laura Bush and Ms. Abe toured) Mount Vernon, keeping one another company during a walk through the estate's gardens.
Got that?  The Prime Minister of our most important Asian ally — some would argue our most important ally worldwide — and his wife visit DC.  Normally, when this happens, while the PM and POTUS are talking business, the US First Lady takes the visiting First Lady on a tour of various sites . . schools, monuments, museums.  In the case of the Japanese, it’s usual for them to visit the Japanese cherry trees at the Tidal Basin — Japan gave us over 3,000 trees in 1912 and the Tidal Basin trees are holy ground.

Not the Trumps.

Ms. Abe was left to her own devices.

On top of this, PM Abe laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown BY HIMSELF — Trump was headed off to Mar-A-Largo, could not be bothered.

The Trump’s may live in a faux-gold-plated penthouse and they may pee in a gold toilet . . . but they are trash without any class or style.

I’ve posted this before, but, I can’t help it. While I didn’t agree with every decision Obama made as President, his calm, welcoming demeanor always had my respect and admiration. Eight years of a scandal-free administration, esteemed in almost every corner of the world, was replaced by a volcanic eruption of stupid, dangerous people who have too much desire for power and no sense whatsoever of the responsibilities of the job.

They are rude. Just impossibly rude; so are his wife and children.

How did the Obamas learn abt diplomacy? Thru natural grace and courtesy (and listening). The Trump family never did anything courteous in their pathetic lives.

Dignity and respect. The Prime Minister showed eminent respect for those whose lives were lost. The soldiers — our soldiers — showed respect both for those lives lost, but also to a Prime Minister who is not their commander-in-chief, but who took the time to pay respect as a Commander-in-Chief to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice in service and love of their country. Everyone there performed their duties solemnly and with utmost dignity, even while being shown the utmost of disrespect from the one person who should have been there but wasn’t.

Dale  accumbens Feb 11 · 07:21:26 AM
From what I remember of European history (and I’m admittedly rusty), in France under the absolutist monarchies of the 17th and 18th centuries, the power of Versailles did not reside alone in the flamboyant baroque detailing and material splendor that the King could show off to the nobility. Power resided in a protocol and a set of practices that showcased the refinement (or exposed the lack of refinement) of anyone who came to court. Exquisite dance steps — which changed with the fashions of the court, and thus tested the alertness of the nobility to the latest currents in style — had to be learned and displayed for all those assembled at quart.

And on top of all that the King, who was holding everyone else up to this standard, had to be the most graceful, the most refined. He had to be the best dancer in the court, and had to have an understanding of the nuances of music. 

I think of all this because I think of Trump’s gaudy Trump Tower penthouse suite, which seems to model itself off of Versailles. And of course, even in that respect, it fails, because Versailles doesn’t really work with low ceilings and shag carpet. It looks stupid.

But beyond that, what has always left Trump at the perimeter of the New York establishment is that he has the money to realize such an extravagant penthouse suite, but none of the personal etiquette or interpersonal grace to back it up. 

The White House is not really Versailles (internecine backstabbing notwithstanding). Protocol does not really rely on dance steps any more — thank God — or on the demonstration of aesthetic refinement. And I would be loathe to reserve the White House for “old money” or for any of the historical trappings of nobility.

But there is a more subtle procedure for doing things; an awareness of the weight of the office that you inhabit, and what it means to be not merely the highest elected official in the land, but the head of state. The White House becomes the showcase to the world of American values in any given time. The way you comport yourself in the White House is an extension of the “soft power” of the Presidency. If the Trumps cannot have respect for that basic element of the job, then they shouldn’t be in the business of running the country.

I don’t see it as a question of class.  Melania simply doesn’t have the skills set to do the job and if she knows it, far better that she should decline than to make an ass out of herself.  She barely speaks English but she could overcome that obstacle if she had enough “people skills” and more importantly a DESIRE to be of service.  More than anything, I think that a first lady needs to have a desire to be of service and basically all of them have had that or at least have done an acceptable level of faking it.

I think that Melania is overwhelmed at the very concept of the job.  And why not?  She’s a professional beauty, she has no background or education, from what I can tell, that has cultivated her to interact with people or be a hostess.

I know any number of women who have functioned in corporate America in various capacities and who can be hostesses to a group of people, make everyone feel comfortable at a party, that sort of thing — Melania can smile for the cameras and that’s it.

As an aside, I had funny misunderstanding the first time I visited Panama. At that time, Mireya Moscoso was the president of Panama. I didn't know much about her but I did know Panama had a female president, because that's still kind of a big deal with all the sexism in the world.

So, one of my Panamanian friends made some comment about Ruby, the First Lady of Panama. I had thought Panama was pretty progressive for having a female president but this was even better! I exclaimed my delight at the news that Panama had a lesbian couple in the presidential palace.

My friends busted up laughing. It turns out that Mireya was widowed at the time so her sister, Ruby, served as the First Lady to do those same kind of functions that our First Ladies do.

He had a great appearance on The Daily Show where he played a game of pool with Trevor Noah and they chatted while Graham showed off his skills, though to be fair Noah was no slouch at pool either.  Had Graham been born in a different time and place, he might have joined the Democrats but instead he made his mental Faustian bargain with The South so here we are.

HOWEVER — the Trump transition people should have addressed this and should have had a fix in place from Day One.  That’s what an organized, efficient, effective executive would have done.  In this case, the Dept of State protocol office likely would have been delighted to help the White House do the right thing, but, there’s no evidence of that having been done.

I’m not going to defend Melania on this. Whether in 2017 you consider it appropriate, sexist, or old school, certain duties of the “domestic” White House fall upon the First Lady and her team. One of the most important of these is White House tours, which fell by the wayside after 1/20/17 and have only been reinstated within the last week or so.

My family and I toured the White House this previous summer and we shifted the dates of our trip from upstate NY to North Carolina in order to accommodate the date and time we had been given for the tour [DC is an approximate halfway point in our two-day drive].

If I had found out that White House tours had been cancelled due to the indifference of the President and First Lady, I would have been pissed off!

According to a CNN article from February 2,

One of the main jobs of the visitors office is keeping members of Congress happy as they get requests from their constituents to visit the White House. Melinda Bates, who was director of the White House Visitors Office during former President Bill Clinton's two terms in office, said a wife of a congressman once paid her a personal visit to deliver an important message: "Access to these tours is more important to my husband's re-election than any speech he will ever give."
The CNN article states that the actual appointment to be Head of the White House Visitors Office is made by the President, and that

…tours have been suspended before, including during the days following President John F. Kennedy's assassination and after the September 11, 2001, attacks.
You might consider the Trump Administration another national emergency...

All three men made my skin CRAWL.

Now it is clear that Ivanka is amazingly good at putting a pretty mask on her family’s and her own hideousness.  If she ever goes into Republican politics, we are fucked!

Melania, first of all, has to KNOW what her jobs are.  There are official protocol experts whose job it is to smooth interactions between administrations and foreign dignitaries;  they are knowledgeable in cultural differences, among other things, to prevent unintentional insults to foreign dignitaries visiting the US.  They, plus a few appropriate civil service experts, could help Melania learn what her duties as FLOUTS are.

I would imagine that someone has talked to Ivanka about her duties...none of which she has done yet. It is entirely possible that the entire office that goes with the FLOTUS has been fired when they handed in their resignations. Hiring new persons to guide her thru her responsibilities should have already been done. That was a part of what the transition period was for...hiring staff.

Frankly any fool would have automatically realized that the PM’s wife would need an escort while visiting and that person would be FLOTUS. The fuckmuppet’s family has just gravely insulted Japan by failing to properly host their PM and his wife.

They don’t give him credit for the political courage it took to do the Bin Laden raid because they don’t see what the big deal was: when you get a chance to swing your fist in someone’s face, you do it.  So naturally they were eager to pull the trigger on the first Seal Team 6 raid that came across their desk.  It clearly didn’t seem to them to be something that needed more thinking through.

Confusion reigns. I was under the impression that Ivanka had taken on the role of FLOTUS. She and hubby Jared moved to Washington and Ivanka has an office in the WH. This has been discussed here quite a few times.

That’s just it, these people are utterly unprepared to handle all the responsibilities of POTUS. They thought they could just show up, “fix” things they way they think it should be, then go golfing or hunting.

And that’s because none of the family really wanted the job. Lord Damp Nuts just wanted to prove he could win, Ivanka just wanted to make Daddy happy, and Melania wanted none of it. 

Remember, Trump just wants his wives to have dinner ready when he gets home. I doubt he has discussed much of anything with Melania and looks to Ivanka for FLOTUS responsibilities. 

I also suspect that if Melania  (and Barron) did come to the WH we would have stories about their relationship leaking out in no time and Trump and his staff are trying to prevent that.

Ivanka has repeatedly said she will not be filling the role of FLOTUS, that Melania will. Ivanka is more interested in (and wanted by Donald for) a policy sidekick. As an example with this visit, she was with Donald and PM Abe rather than with with Mrs. Abe.

Good question!  Assuming that he didn't just show up unannounced, there had to be arrangements made for security, schedules, soldiers to uniform up, etc.  And no one planned for social obligations?  If fucking Bannon let this oversight slide on purpose to create ill will among nations I’ll be even more pissed than I am now.  And I HATE that my mind now goes to crazy ct theories because its not that farfetched any more!

I could understand it if Trump were sick with appendicitis, or gangrene or an emergency trepanning. But his no-show was because he went off to play fucking golf.

Having lived in post-war Japan and experienced the exquisite politeness and consideration of the people there, the action(s) of this president makes me shiver in reaction.  Trump has no idea the awful insult he has paid to this respected head of state.  He’s not only an insufferable bully who doesn’t seem to learn from past mistakes, he is also well on his way to driving away strong allies.  No wonder he’s forbidden to speak before Parliament and a visit to Great Britain is discouraged in very strong terms.

PM Abe laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns is a big deal. He’ll deal with significant repercussions about that on his right flank at home. It will be taken as an apology for WWII which remains controversial in some parts of Japanese society. It would be like an American President going to Hanoi and laying a wreath at a war memorial there.

He barfed and then passed out.  They thought at first that he’d had a heart attack and died.

Then they made the excuse that he’d been having a case of flu.  Well, that’s not what flu does.  But I’ll tell you what DOES do that, to susceptible people: MSG.  I know because that’s what it does to me.

The Japanese invented MSG and use it even more extensively than the Chinese do.  That’s why I will never visit either country.

The lie about the flu was to save Japanese face.  But I bet they told them about it in private, and I bet that now if an American dignitary has any sort of formal meal in Japan, there is no MSG in the food.

Actually, the President did have the flu, which had been circulating through his aides during their twelve day tour of Asia.  It was sudden, virulent, and the fact that the President didn’t get it until the end of the trip is a testament to his immune system.  He started to feel unwell in the afternoon (including vomiting), had to bow out of a receiving line, and held out until the toasts before becoming violently ill and fainting.

And oh, as for your theory about MSG?  The menu was entirely Western, not Japanese, unless cold salmon, caviar, medallions of beef, clear soup, and ice cream somehow qualify.

One thing I will say about the seriousness of hosting guests for Japanese, they expect the best, but they return that in spades when it’s their turn. I would take our Japanese distributor for Sushi, I swear the little guys can eat their own weight in sushi, and they know all the most expensive types on the menu. So I took an entourage of five with the translator and it cost over a grand. In Japan they took us to a place where single items cost almost that much. They were trying to shock and appall my business partner by insisting that it would be an insult to turn something down, to where he was on the edge of gagging. I simply said “no I’ll pass” and it was left at that.

Before anyone gets too tempted to lionize the Abe’s for Trump’s slight to them, I should point out that PM Abe Shinzo is a conservative nationalist in his own right and has built his campaign on denying that Japanese WW2 war crimes ever happened and provoking China and South Korea.

I mean, it’s obvious that the WH is amateur hour right now.  But I do wonder if this is a vestige of eras where women had fewer opportunities.  Speaking generally, the President is a federal official with official obligations, but First Ladies take no oath of office.  Is it time for the duties of the First Lady to be carried out by professional civil servants rather than have the wife of a president work for free — especially working for free on things that in an earlier era were viewed as “women’s work” — decorating and entertaining for guests.

What would have happened had HRC won?  Would Bill Clinton be picking out ornately-decorated dishes and color-coordinating window treatments and carpeting?  It strikes me that it’s time to rename and fully professionalize the First Lady’s office and truly let the First Spouse decide how — and whether — they want to serve the White House.

If the First Spouse wants to keep their day job then the First Family can buy their own goddamned china, drapes, and carpeting. Hell, they should pay rent for living in such a beautiful well-maintained home.

Especially if the taxpayers are expected to foot the bill for an official host/hostess.

She’s not much of a host considering her Yugoslav roots. You’ll know what I’m talking about if you’ve ever visited a former Yugoslav country for any period of time. I read somewhere that she hasn’t been back to Slovenia since she married Trump and hadn’t been back much since starting her modeling career. She’s surely lost some of that culture over the years . She even changed the spelling of her name from Melanija Knavs to Melania Knauss. She almost seems to be running away from those early roots. I wouldn’t be surprised if her and Barron aren’t even allowed to speak Slovenian in Trump’s presence because it annoys him. I guess living with Trump for so long would do that to anyone. She came from such humble beginnings, but now she’s such a Trump.

It doesn’t take a genius to know that Melania Trump is not going to be fulfilling the duties of first lady. And there is no law that says she has to. However, it is probably Reince Priebus' fault that the White House doesn’t have sufficient social staff in place to have found a suitable substitute hostess for foreign dignitaries’ wives. Ivanka would have been the natural choice, but surely there Mrs. Pence could have filled in lacking anyone of higher rank.

Does a woman sign her life away when her husband takes a new job?
In the case of POTUS and FLOTUS, generally speaking — yes.  That’s why men who’ve run for the job have traditionally conferred with their wives before starting.

Aamof — Michelle Obama was not really interested in the job of FLOTUS [and it IS a job, (and a full time one) no matter what people might think — and like so much “woman’s work” — an unpaid one.]  Still, when the call did come, she stepped forward with dignity and grace.

Also, aamof — wives of men who hold jobs high up in the private sector [CEO’s, COO’s, etc) generally hold jobs just as difficult as those of their husbands.  And again, those jobs are unpaid.  Being a gracious hostess is not easy.  Odds are Melania hasn’t held that job either — thus her incapacity in her current situation.

No, it’s not Melania’s fault Trump didn’t include her in the decision — but then he never expected to WIN.  Once it began to look like he stood a chance, the two of them needed to make other arrangements if she wasn’t willing to take it on.

Again, probably not her fault this didn’t get done either.  But someone needs to step up and do it.  His sister might be a good candidate.  After all, she has been a judge — so she has some sense of these things, as he certainly does not.

Well, as a Japanese American, I didn’t want Abe to visit dumpty anyway.  He should have stayed home and kept the $700 million investment in US jobs until we get a real POTUS.  God only knows what the snake oil salesman will sell the PM, but optically, it’s not a pretty pic of them playing golf.  Hope he had the common sense to have his room checked for bugs, at least he didn’t book a room at the dumpty motel in DC. As for mrs. dumpty, she’s not invested into being FLOTUS.  There’s no payoff for her, she has experience as arm candy only, and what does she know about the places they would have visited. But, what I would like to know, since they’re touting her as FLOTUS stand-in, what the hell was Fluffy from 5th Ave. doing?  Yup, send the spouse of the PM of Japan on a self-guided tour; maybe the PM will have learned from this debacle.  Oh, all visiting presidents and pms, you’re only good for pix with 45; as for anything else, you might get served KFC or Mickey D’s for a state dinner.  You noticed, no state dinner at the WH.

It’s hard to escape the belief that Trump was raised very badly— never taught any manners. he’s a great example of the wrongness of inherited wealth. He’s unpleasant, obnoxious, rude— and he got elected president. The people who voted for him wouldn’t invite him to their kid’s birthday party, but they voted for him for president. And now they’re making excuses for him. “He’s got more important things to do than (whatever).” Yeah, like taking his second vacation in a month. From being president.

Having the good fortune (as it is generally considered) to have been born with a silver spoon in the mouth does not mean that one is innately respectful, well-mannered and intelligent.  Unless one also is born into a family where responsibility, duty, honor, humility and other virtues too numerous to list, the “rich kid” often turns out to be an irresponsible, reprehensible, egotistical, selfish, arrogant and spoiled narcissist (just to mention a FEW of his/her “endearing qualities”).

That said, why would anyone be shocked about donny’s behavior now?  Those who voted for this “work of art”, this “useful fool”, this “I’m not a puppet” (and continue to overtly and/or tacitly support their chosen “leader”) will have to deal with consequences.  My fervent prayer is that it will not last so long that our nation will not be able to recover from the madness before it is too late.

The individuals who have populated Cervantes’ “pueblo idiota” now have their tyrant.  Although most (if not all) of us will experience inconvenience and discomfort, those “good Christians” will suffer more because the more aware will eventually understand that they committed not only an immeasurable injustice but also treason against the very nation that they swear that they love.  I have felt for years that we needed a good slap in the face.  i had hoped that it would not be with a spike-studded steel gauntlet.

Melania could have taken her shopping, at Nordstroms! To buy some Ivanka line clothing.

On top of this, PM Abe laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown BY HIMSELF — Trump was headed off to Mar-A-Largo, could not be bothered.
How do we even begin to apologize for the imbecilic non statesman at the helm?  What an ass..he is just incapable of understanding this stuff is important.

Supposedly, Melania has hired a social secretary, Niceta Lloyd.

Natalie Jones, the former deputy chief of protocol under President Barack Obama has taken herself out of consideration for the position.

All that being said, there are plenty of people who could have guided her through this weekend, informing her of what’s usual in a state visit, especially a visitor who holds such a prominent position as one of our allies.  The Japanese set great store by hospitality, decorum, protocol and manners. That this couple, of all of our allies, should be treated so cavalierly is embarrassing and undignified. At the very least, Karen Pence, in my mind, would have been the proper, logical choice to escort the PM's wife if Melania did not want to do it.  The idea of a staffer filling that role just seems really tacky.

I understand that this is new to her, but of all people, she only has to ask one or two questions and an army of experts would instantly be right there to assist her. Every First Lady has to find her way and establish her agenda, but hosting a visiting dignitary and his wife should be pretty basic.  Melania has for years held a position in society in New York and presumably, hosting events and guests is not something with which she should be unfamiliar.

That calls to question the idea of whether she even intends to fulfill some sort of role as First Lady, or if she even plans to live in the White House. My money is on no, but I've been wrong before.  Like being so sure we would never be in this position, with these people in the White House, in the first place.

Trump and Abe travelled together to Mar-A-Lago. Let’s get our facts straight. He may have gone to lay the wreath alone but I know all 4 boarded that plane on Friday together.

The Trumps are trashy.    Even without knowing protocol — and, ok, I’ll give them a break for being the outsiders they are — but simple common decency means you don’t chuck the visitors!  

Trash.   Embarrassments to our country.

According to the caption of the picture in the Defense Video Imagery System, the Prime Minister was escorted by Maj. Gen. Mark S. Inch, commanding general, U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command and U.S. Army Correction Command.  First of all, a major general is not the highest ranking general — that’s a lieutenant general — and secondly, one might wonder why a general with those particular responsibilities was chosen.

President white trash and his equally trashy wife are the epitome of low class. Ignorant self centered idiots. There’s no Hillary Clinton to lie about and demean and now the attention is on trump and his band of imbeciles. Thanks to all you putin loving trump traitors for voting this bag of low class crap into the highest office in the land.
