The true American majority owes thanks to the Attorney General of the State of Washington, Bob Ferguson, and the Attorney General of the State of Minnesota, Lori Swanson, and their gifted and hard working Assistant Attorneys General who have so far stymied the Trump Administration’s Muslim travel ban.  Once upon a time, for almost the entire Ronald Reagan Administration, I was a Civil Division trial and appellate lawyer for a State Attorney General, actually, three of them, all Democrats.  I litigated high profile cases in the federal District Courts and argued appeals in the federal Circuit Courts and the U.S. Supreme Court.  Looking back on a legal career that spanned four decades and encompassed diverse practice situations and specialties, I find that my time at the State Capital were my best years.  

Those were the years when, temporarily, thankfully, I became a public figure.  In my official capacity I gave interviews to reporters, appeared on call in radio shows and gave press conferences.  My name appeared in news reports from time to time, including newspaper editorials.  I conducted my State’s business, accompanying an advising senior State officials on affairs as they traveled from coast to coast and wherever happenstance attracted the interest of or entangled our State.  

Just one war story.  Our landlocked little State in flyover country had weird liquor laws that wound up entangling us with California and the entire American liquor industry in a widely reported Commerce Clause case that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.  I led the briefing team and was slotted to do the oral argument in Washington.  Our case wasn’t actually very strong but I knew the support for our position better than anyone in the office.  Then, at a very late moment, the First Assistant Attorney General stepped in and insisted on taking the argument himself.  He was much further along than I in his career and he figured he was looking at his last chance to do a U.S. Supreme  Court oral argument, something only a tiny percentage of lawyers ever do.  His lack of any experience doing appellate oral arguments and unfamiliarity with the actual law and facts of the case took a backseat to his desire to have the experience.  The First Assistant answers only to the Attorney General himself (or herself, happily these days) so that is how it played out.  The State lost the Supremes 9-0.  It has always been my conceit that if I had argued the case I could have won over at least one vote.  But then again, they were my team’s briefs.  

So I write tonight to express my support for, thanks to and affinity with the superhero Assistant Attorneys General of Washington and Minnesota and their courageous leaders, AG’s Ferguson and Swanson.  I have never been prouder than now of my own service working for good, brave and honorable State Attorneys General.

Remember this. The Bernie idiots were sending death threats to Gov Inslee because he supported Hillary. No more of that, eh? Good folks can differ, but don't suggest that someone isn't completely committed and on our side because of those differences. No more of that!

No one is smearing Bernie...it is a fact that after the Washington Caucus which Bernie won, some of his supporters in that state made death threats to Gov. Inslee because he supported HRC...and it is a fact that they were, indeed, idiots for doing so.

Any who supported Bernie in WA but did not want the Governor dead for his choosing to support HRC is not counted in that number and has no reason to take umbrage.

A Hillary supporter murdered someone. A Hillary supporter raped someone. A Hillary supporter robbed someone.

So, “the Hillary idiots” are murderers, rapists, robbers.

Saying “The Bernie idiots” implies group blame generalizing to Bernie supporters. It’s the wrong way to say that.

Mine as well.  Some say Jay may for President.  Ferguson could be a young leader but he needs to learn how to do a press conference.  I watched him on the news tonight and he kept throwing his head back and forth from side to side to speak to both sides of the room.  He looked awful on camera.

Did you know that Bob Ferguson is a chess champion who used to compete in chess tournaments in Russia?  He said he started to huddle with his team and plan how to respond to this Muslim ban right after DT won the election. He was ready and waiting right out of the gate!  Very, very smart combined with ethical and decent. He is absolutely passionate about defending the constitution.

A diverse career involving different areas of practice and different employments is an excellent way to get the most out of life as a lawyer. It sounds like you have some nice highlights to recall.

I gotta wonder how many people on this website have experience in appellate litigation at the level of the Supreme Court. It really does take your breath away, even if you only get to do it once.

I have a friend who argued one case before the Supreme Court. He lost but the experience nonetheless thrilled him and he always focuses on the experience rather than on the outcome. He is a co-founder of the organization that brought marriage equality to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Excellent questions.  I think I can give some helpful answers.

Can you explain what they mean when they say the merits have not been argued, but will be? Why haven’t they yet? What did they argue on if not merits?
This started in a trial court in front of a U.S. District Judge.  He issued a temporary restraining order based upon findings that the Muslim ban was causing immediate and irreparable damage to persons under the protection of the States of Washington and Minnesota.  The trial judge also found, on the limited evidence available that the plaintiff’s were likely to ultimately win on the merits.  

Trump’s Justice Department appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals asking that the injunction issued by the trial court be lifted while the litigation moves forward.  So, the question of the ultimate merits of the case has not yet reached the 9th Circuit and will not do so until the evidence is fully developed during litigation at the trial court.  So, the only question in front of the 9th Circuit was whether to vacate the temporary restraining order.  The case will now go forward in the District Court with the injunction in place until a final decision on the merits, which could go either way.  At that point the losing party can appeal to the 9th Circuit again, and only then will the 9th Circuit be in a position to adjudicate the decision reached by the lower court on the merits.  

Do you agree that the decision is likely to be overturned because the 9th circuit has such a high rate of overturning
To be sure, the 9th Circuit is less conservative than the Supreme Court and this is reflected in the frequency with which the Supremes overturn decisions from the 9th Circuit.  But such statistical oddities have no predictive value for individual cases.  The decision of the 9th Circuit will be decided on its own merits, if the Supreme Court affords it an honest hearing.  

what about Immigration and Nationality Act, is that the slam dunk to overturn that conservatives believe it will be?
While the INA appears on its face to allow unfettered discretion to any President to bar entry to any alien, no President’s power, no matter how broadly granted by statute, may be used to contravene the U.S. Constitution’s prohibitions against certain kinds of discrimination, such as on the basis of religion or national origin.  Because Trump and others in his Administration have been so unrestrained in expressing their discriminatory animus towards Muslims, the ultimate outcome will not be the slam dunk that Trump and the Trumpettes believe it should be.

Re:  INA/last paragraph — Oh, good, it doesn’t allow the Pres. to override the Constitution!  Limbaugh was hollering about that this morning — “ . . . been in place since 1952, the Pres. can bar any alien . . . .”  Ugh, I cannot stand his voice.  He is so hate-filled.

People should bear in mind that the vast majority — I believe well over 99% — of 9th Circuit rulings aren’t taken up by the Supreme Court. That’s the context in which you refer to the rates as “statistical oddities.” SCOTUS overturns most appellate rulings that it does take up, but those are anything but a representative sample.

Marriage equality came before the Supreme Court (the second time, in 2015) only because one circuit, the 6th, ruled against it after several others had ruled favorably.

Thank YOU for being down in the trenches, and doing the hard work of preserving a stable and sane society.

I found this piece today that discusses the power of institutional inertia in maintaining stability, as well as the power of speaking out in activating those institutions. I found it very hopeful. Now, I’m not qualified to discuss it in any deep way, but I’m wondering if you have any thoughts on it, or if you might like to include some of the thinking in your future (sure to be great) diaries.

I’ve been blessed to live in a state with powerful attorneys general — NY — and I’m delighted to know that the Dem AGs are in touch on a regular basis to plan how to fight this administration. I also saw Noah Purcell, the Washington solicitor general who argued the case, on Hardball the other night and was mightily impressed (and a bit smitten, I confess). Even Alan Dershowitz, who was on with Purcell, was impressed, although he didn’t think Purcell would prevail!

I suspect that between the outpouring of lawyers, immigration specialists or not, to the airports on Jan. 28 and the efforts of the blue states’ attorneys, many more young people will be induced to choose a profession that all too often is maligned.

LeftOfYou, I have a question that you may have some insight into it answer.

The GOP keeps creating laws against women’s right, union rights, and voter rights. As well as gerrymandering every state they control.

It is possible to get multiple state AG to sue the other states or Congress and get permanent injunction against multiple states on these whack-a-mole GOP tactics?

The GOP has caused injury to every voter and state with distorting the representation in Congress affecting citizens rights and services from the both state and federal government.

I hesitate to jump in here not only because I am not the diarist but also because I’m not lawyer. I have, however, followed any number of cases where standing was an issue (think the suit against CA Prop 8). A great many things are left up to the judgement of the individual states, including such things as women’s rights, union rights and voter rights. States can regulate these areas pretty much as they see fit, within the boundaries of the Constitution. This applies even in relatively non-contentious areas. So, for example, even states that don’t oppose abortion may regulate it in any number of different ways, none of which fall afoul of Roe v Wade or later decisions. Likewise states are permitted to regulate elections in a variety of ways.

Just at first blush, it would seem a real stretch for a state AG to attempt to prove that his or her state had standing to bring a suit over another state’s law, though undoubtedly there are situations where such a thing could occur (just not here). So no matter how meritorious the arguments might be, standing would pretty much present a block unless it could be proven that citizens of the state bringing the suit were somehow being injured directly and concretely by the legislative actions of the state being sued and that bringing a suit to overturn the offending law(s) would be the most appropriate means of addressing the injury.

Thank you, congratulations, and thanks for writing this.  As a professional who worked for 17 years in state public health, a tip o’ my hat goes to government professionals.   The slings and arrows of being referenced as “gummint workers”; “bureaucrats”; and “widgets” or, as my TP governor called us “corrupt public civil servants” is the usual experience, as well as knowing  we could have made far more money on the private side), but most of us are “mission-driven”.     Here you are celebrating, and rightly so.  It’s ironic that what has happened in the past few months has actually helped the profile of those who toil outside the limelight with great love for the common good.
