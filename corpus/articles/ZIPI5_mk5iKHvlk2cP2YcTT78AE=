Support MoveOn's Fight Against Trump's Agenda and Get Bernie's New Book
By Tzyh Ng. Tuesday, December 6 2016
In the aftermath of Trump’s victory, Bernie Sanders’ new book, “Our Revolution,” is an essential read—and it’s already a bestseller.

In the book, Bernie provides a blueprint for how to revitalize the Democratic Party and win back power from wealthy corporations and big donors, so we can fix the rigged system and build a country that works for all of us.

Want a limited-edition copy of Bernie’s book from MoveOn? Instead of giving your money to a big, corporate bookseller, you can get Bernie’s book while helping MoveOn make Bernie’s political revolution a reality.

Yes, I want a limited-edition MoveOn copy of Bernie’s new book, “Our Revolution.”

MoveOn members have worked closely with Bernie for years—opposing the war in Iraq, defending Social Security, and most recently overwhelmingly supporting his campaign for president. Now—as Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress assume power in Washington, D.C.—Bernie’s vision is more important than ever.

That’s because the political revolution is about how ordinary people, by the millions, can transform America by standing up and fighting for justice and a bold, progressive agenda.

This is the book that every progressive MUST have—and buying it from MoveOn is a truly progressive way to get it.

Click here now for a limited-edition MoveOn copy of Bernie’s new book.

Recently, we saw just what is possible when people stand up and stand together.

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe stood up against outrageous corporate greed. And they won. The Obama administration denied the final permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline.

We cannot give up hope. We must resist Trump and set the agenda for the America of tomorrow, together.

Get a limited-edition copy of Bernie’s book from MoveOn now to prepare for the big fights ahead.

Thanks for all you do.

P.S. If you already have a copy of “Our Revolution,” it also makes a great gift, and we’ll be sure to get it to you in time for the holidays. Get your limited-edition MoveOn copy of Bernie’s new book now.
