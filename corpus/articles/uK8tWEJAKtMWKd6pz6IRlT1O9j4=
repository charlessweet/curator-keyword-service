SEN. TIM SCOTT KNOWS ALL TOO WELL THE INTOLERANCE OF THE LEFT'S 'TOLERANCE'

To the Left not only is gender fluid, but apparently so are definitions as well.

Take ‚Äútolerance‚Äù for example. A word that used to mean ‚Äúputting up with, or even accommodating, things we don‚Äôt agree with provided doing so doesn‚Äôt impose on my God-given rights/conscience in the process.‚Äù Now it means ‚Äúyou will believe and behave as progressives see fit, otherwise we‚Äôll make you wish your daddy had worn a condom instead.‚Äù Which, of course, would seem to be the very definition of intolerance, but self-awareness and irony often clash in the social justice warrior world.

Besides, I‚Äôm also stricken with heteronormative white privilege, so I couldn‚Äôt possibly know what these terms mean. Or, because I‚Äôm white I have been a part of a bigoted effort to determine what they mean. Which is it? It‚Äôs all so confusing, so let‚Äôs consult somebody who isn‚Äôt white and also seems sorta smart. ¬†

How about somebody like South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, R-S.C. (B, 89%)? I mean, he‚Äôs black and all, so right away he‚Äôs qualified to speak of such things according to the Left ‚Äî who tells us not to pay attention to race, but also to only pay attention to race at the same time. Got it? Good, because I don‚Äôt.

Except Scott isn‚Äôt really black, according to the Left, despite the fact his skin appears to be. This week, Scott shared some of the ‚Äútolerance‚Äù he‚Äôs received for supporting Jeff Sessions for attorney general:

Senator Tim Scott is not an Uncle Tom ‚Äî he doesn‚Äôt have a shred of honor. He‚Äôs a house negro, like the one in ‚ÄòDjango [Unchained].‚Äô

[Mr. Scott is a] black man who is racist against black people. Big Uncle Tom piece of fertilizer.

This, you see, is why when Starbucks suggested that we have ‚Äúa conversation about race,‚Äù most Americans tapped out and said they would be over in the corner eating broken glass instead.

Whereas Scott even said he left out the tweets that used the n-word, progressives view that kind of self-editing as weakness instead of class. Their quest for pagan dystopia has been taken to an ‚Äòends justify the means‚Äô level where hypocrisy and decorum are words totally without meaning.

Safe spaces and trigger warnings for me, but not for thee.

That‚Äôs how Scott can simultaneously be a threat to the future of democracy while the white suburbia brats levelling such charges against him can be certain of their righteousness, as they anonymously mace defenseless young women wearing ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù hats. They both clearly had it coming.

What wonderful mental and moral gymnastics are at play here. After the Ferguson and Baltimore riots, any use of the word ‚Äúthug‚Äù for those who were pillaging their own city was deemed as coded language for racism by the SJW punditry and social media trolls. But actually call somebody a house negro and not only is it not racist, but it is salvific.

There are no rules but to rule, says progressivism. Go bigoted, or go home. Tolerance hurts, dude.

The squares on the Left, who haven‚Äôt yet been willing to condone violence and harsh rhetoric in the name of protesting President Trump, were lectured about this recently by a current Nevada State Democratic Party field organizer. She said that calls for nonviolent protest were ‚Äúcowardly‚Äù and ‚Äúa violent act‚Äù in and of themselves because ‚Äî believe it or not George W. Bush fans ‚Äî it ignores the need to engage in pre-emptive strikes against bullies.

There is no other word for this but madness.

That‚Äôs how a man like Scott can be targeted for such a cheap and vile character assassination. According to progressives, he‚Äôs betraying his race if he‚Äôs driving the getaway car. Or how a woman like Kellyanne Conway can be shamed as a liar with zero sense of misogynistic irony, only months after liar-in-chief Hillary Clinton was on the presidential ballot and hailed as the ‚Äúnasty woman‚Äù we needed.

First woman to run a winning presidential campaign or not, Conway‚Äôs not considered a real woman by the Left. At the same time, they‚Äôre nevertheless claiming gender is an outdated social construct.

This is our world. The world we are preparing to hand off to our children in the mere blink of an eye. A man can be absolutely sure he is really a woman, and everyone else must comply with every twist and variant of that pathology. Yet you forfeit your right to the dignity of your God-given race and gender if the tolerance mob decides you haven‚Äôt checked the right boxes.

There is no other word for this but madness.
