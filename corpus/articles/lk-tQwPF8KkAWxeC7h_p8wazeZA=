SAY WUT? ELIZABETH WARREN WAS PRO-SCHOOL CHOICE BEFORE SHE WANTED TO BE A POLITICIAN

It‚Äôs hard to believe now that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. (F, 18%) used to be a Republican, but she was. And even after she became a Democrat in 1995, she still retained some conservative views. In her 2003 book, ‚ÄúThe Two-Income Trap,‚Äù Warren (along with her co-author daughter) championed school choice, writing enthusiastically in favor of school vouchers as a way to empower the middle class.

Here are three of her fervent arguments in favor of school choice, per ‚ÄúThe Two-Income Trap‚Äù:

1. Fully funded vouchers would empower parents
Warren, 2003: ‚ÄúA taxpayer-funded voucher that paid the entire cost of educating a child (not just a partial subsidy) would open a range of opportunities to all children. With fully funded vouchers, parents of all income levels could send their children‚Äîand the accompanying financial support‚Äîto the schools of their choice.

2. Vouchers are the ‚Äúshock‚Äù the education system needs
Warren, 2003: ‚ÄúAn all-voucher system would be a shock to the educational system, but the shakeout might be just what the system needs.‚Äù

3. Vouchers take power from bureaucrats ‚Äî and that‚Äôs a good thing
Warren, 2003: ‚ÄúUnder a public school voucher program, parents, not bureaucrats, would have the power to pick schools for their children‚Äîand to choose which schools would get their children‚Äôs vouchers. Students would be admitted to a particular public school on the basis of their talents, their interests, or even their lottery numbers; their zip codes would be irrelevant.‚Äù

... Fast-forward 14 years later ...

Betsy DeVos, a prominent school-choice advocate, is nominated to be President Trump‚Äôs secretary of education. Outraged by DeVos‚Äô policy positions, Sen. Warren sent her a letter, decrying DeVos‚Äô school-choice agenda to ‚Äúdrain valuable taxpayer resources‚Äù ‚Äî contradicting what Warren herself wrote not too long ago.

Consider these three contradictions:

1. Voucher programs don‚Äôt work
Warren, 2017: ‚ÄúActual evidence on how private voucher programs affect educational outcomes is mixed at best.‚Äù

2. Voucher programs abet racism
Warren, 2017: ‚ÄúThese private voucher programs also have a racially-charged history. Historically, private school vouchers have been used by some states to further racial and socioeconomic segregation‚Ä¶.Today‚Äôs voucher schemes can be just as harmful‚Ä¶[by] funneling public dollars to unaccountable private schools that are not held to the same academic or civil rights standards as public schools.‚Äù

3. Voucher programs siphon public education funds
Warren, 2017: Voucher programs ‚Äúsiphon away much-needed public education funds with no strings attached, sidestepping standards and protections from discrimination.‚Äù

Despite the strong opposition of Warren and her Democratic colleagues, Betsy DeVos was confirmed as secretary of education. Sen. Warren criticizes DeVos‚Äô education policies, but Warren believed the same things just 14 years ago. Not only did Warren believe school vouchers would empower parents and students, but that it would free parents from being trapped in neighborhoods where the public schools aren‚Äôt good. Every family, whether poor, middle class, or wealthy, would benefit from more choice and say.

Warren believed the same things she attacked DeVos for. Of course, that was before she wanted to run for office.

Political opportunism does strange things, doesn‚Äôt it?¬†

As Conservative Review‚Äôs Nate Madden said:

Looks like Sen. Warren's views on school choice are about as authentic as the feathers on her head: https://t.co/3lMtPKJ6CU
