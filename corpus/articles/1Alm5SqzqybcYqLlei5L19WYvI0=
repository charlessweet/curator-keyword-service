SENATORS COTTON AND PERDUE'S NEW BILL TAKES A BOLT CUTTER TO ENDLESS CHAIN MIGRATION

If one wants to know what an ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù approach to reforming our legal immigration system looks like, one need look no further than the bill introduced by Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. (C, 76%) and David Perdue, R-Ga. (C, 75%).

On Tuesday, the duo introduced the Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment (RAISE) Act, which would restructure our immigration system to better address the needs of the American people.


All in all, Sen. Cotton‚Äôs office press release states, ‚ÄúThe RAISE Act would lower overall immigration to 637,960 in its first year and to 539,958 by its tenth year ‚Äî a 50 percent reduction from the 1,051,031 immigrants who arrived in 2015.‚Äù

Cotton and Purdue state such a reduction would restore ‚Äúlegal immigration levels to their historical norms and rebalancing the system toward employment-based visas and immediate-family household members.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor over a quarter century, the United States has accepted an average of 1 million immigrants annually ‚Äî the equivalent of adding the entire state of Montana each year,‚Äù reads a joint one-pager from Cotton and Perdue‚Äôs offices. ‚ÄúBut when only 1 out of every 15 immigrants arrives in the United States on a skills-based visa, the majority of the remaining immigrants are either low-skill or unskilled.‚Äù

The effort to end extended family preferences and focus on skilled immigration may seem heartless to some ‚Äî especially paired with POLITICO‚Äôs headline referring to the proposed reforms as a clean-cut ‚Äúcrackdown‚Äù on legal immigration ‚Äî but the issue bears some serious examination.

The current immigration system does far more than simply prioritize family ties over professional skills when it comes to what visas are issued. By its current design, it also creates what Conservative Review Senior Editor Daniel Horowitz calls a ‚Äúpernicious‚Äù ‚Äúsystem that empowers immigrants to bring in an unlimited number of relatives‚Äù in his 2016 book ‚ÄúStolen Sovereignty.‚Äù ¬†

In contrast, the RAISE Act would retain visa preferences for the immediate families of citizens and green card holders seeking to come in, while eliminating preferences for extended and adult family members that are currently on the books.

Right now, if someone gains a visa based on a desired skill, he can not only bring over his wife and children, but his brothers, sisters, cousins, parents, in-laws ‚Ä¶ the list goes on. Once those extended family members have permanent residence status, they can also bring in other members of THEIR extended family. This phenomenon is known as ‚Äúchain migration.‚Äù

This phenomenon effectively takes immigration decision-making out of the American people‚Äôs hands ¬†and puts it into the hands of those seeking entry.

What this means, in practice, is a system where roughly 65 percent of America‚Äôs annual immigration is based on family ties, rather than skills and other potential benefits to our economy and country.

Add in refugee programs and the outdated Diversity Visa Lottery ‚Äì which the RAISE Act also eliminates ‚Äì and you‚Äôve got roughly 85 percent of legal immigration to the United States based on factors that play no role in the wellbeing of her citizens. This is the antithesis of what the American people voted for in 2016.

This RAISE bill would maintain the cohesion of nuclear families, while closing the extended family loophole and setting the annual overall refugee limit for permanent residency at a sensible 50,000.

‚ÄúFor too long, our immigration policy has skewed toward the interests of the wealthy and powerful: Employers get cheaper labor, and professionals get cheaper personal services like housekeeping,‚Äù Sen. Cotton astutely noted in The New York Times earlier this year. In the same op-ed, he also ¬†teased systematic reforms that would focus ‚Äúless on the most powerful and more on everyone else.‚Äù

Even Republicans who have pushed softer, amnesty-laden immigration ‚Äúreform‚Äù like former presidential candidates Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fl. (C, 74%) in years past have emphasized the need to refocus our legal immigration system on skilled labor, rather than the current. The RAISE Act would appear to be a step in that direction.
