California MoveOn Members Vote to Endorse Kamala Harris for U.S. Senate

** 86% of Votes Cast by MoveOn Members in California to Endorse Kamala Harris for U.S. Senate **

CALIFORNIA — California members of MoveOn.org Political Action have voted to endorse progressive champion Kamala Harris in the state’s U.S. Senate race with 86% of votes cast in favor of backing Harris.

Harris is running for the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer. MoveOn has more than 625,000 members in California.

As California’s Attorney General, Harris made history with her 2010 election as the first woman, African American and Asian American attorney general. She has made waves throughout her career from her early days with the Alameda County District Attorney’s office and serving as District Attorney for San Francisco.  The New York Times Magazine called Harris as a “Top Cop” in the era of Black Lives Matter as she works to reform criminal justice from an unusual peak.

“MoveOn members are mobilizing nationwide to ensure Donald Trump never steps foot in the White House – and show that Americans clearly reject his politics of hate – while helping to elect Democrats like Kamala Harris and advance progressive policies,” said Ilya Sheyman, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action.

Here’s what a few MoveOn members in the state had to say about Harris:

“I have been a fan of hers since she ran for State A.G. I’m very proud of the way she has gone after corporations like ExxonMobil. She understands that crime doesn’t happen in a vacuum and that locking everyone up doesn’t fix the underlying problems.” – Eric H. from Lake Forest, CA

“She has a history of making positive, solid decisions in the past as Attorney General.”– Laura P. from Chatsworth, CA

“She has proven her ability and strong progressive credentials on many issues, from reforms to the criminal justice system to standing up to the federal government and the banks to get a better deal for California during the mortgage crisis. I have met her and spoken with her and really trust her ethics and long term commitment to social justice and issues affecting women and people of color.” – Kathryn R. from Napa, CA



The endorsement comes the same day that MoveOn.org launched a “Take Back the Senate” effort, with MoveOn members in five states also voting to endorse Ann Kirkpatrick (Arizona), Maggie Hassan (New Hampshire), Michael Bennet (Colorado), Deborah Ross (North Carolina), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nevada), and Katie McGinty (Pennsylvania). Earlier this year, MoveOn members voted to endorse progressive diplomacy champions Tammy Duckworth (Illinois}, Russ Feingold (Wisconsin), and Ted Strickland (Ohio) in their respective Senate races.

In addition to “Take Back the Senate” endorsements, MoveOn members have also endorsed House candidates Mike Honda (California 17th), Pramila Jayapal (Washington 7th), and Zephyr Teachout (New York 19th); and Kim Foxx for Cook County State’s Attorney (Illinois).

In the 2014 election cycle, MoveOn members made over 6.7 million phone calls for endorsed candidates. MoveOn members have also raised millions of dollars—including more than $1 million for Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s Senate race in Massachusetts in 2012 and more than $1.2 million for Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign in 2016—mobilized volunteers, and run ads in support of endorsed candidates across the country.

MoveOn.org Political Action represents the collective will of MoveOn’s members at the ballot box by helping to elect progressive candidates.
