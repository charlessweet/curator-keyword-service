Why did not one MSM stenographer ask Lord Dampnut with Japanese PM Abe present in their presser, why the current Executive Orders scooping up undocumented persons seemed much like Executive Order 9066 in 1942.

This. Is. Not. The. Same.

1) In the first case, a group of people (mostly US citizens) were rounded up solely based on their ethnicity and placed in camps.

2) In the second case, people who are not allowed to be in the country are removed. Maybe a little bit too harsh, but every US administration has done this (Obama removed unauthorized immigrants, Bush did so, Clinton did so, and every of his predecessors).

It was wrong then, wrong now.  Veterans?  Mothers who have lived here for 20 years?  Are you thinking these Mexicans are not rounded up because of their ethnicity?  Placed in detention centers.

Mexicans with legal status (should) not be impacted. The point is, there are limits to how many immigrants get accepted each year. Mothers who are present for 20 years should be able to get a visa through family reunification one way or the other.

Anyways, Drumpfs priorities are not correct. But this is another case than Japanese internment. The proposed “Muslim registry” falls into that category, as does the Muslim ban in general. This though is just a harsher version of immigration enforcement that has been the norm for decades.

Maybe tomorrow I won’t be, but then, maybe I will.
