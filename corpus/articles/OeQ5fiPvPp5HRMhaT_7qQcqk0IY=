T****'s favorable rating, at 41%, has today reached its lowest point so far as POTUS.

His net favorable rating is -12%, which is tied for his most negative total. Needless to say, both of these numbers are far worse than any other President at this same point in his term since Gallup began measuring.

The news isn't any better for other aspects of his administration. Rex Tillerson checks in at 36% favorable and 33% unfavorable, for a +3 net favorability rating. Here's how other recent Secretaries of State rated at a similar point in their tenures:

Kerry (4/2013) +9 Clinton (1/2009) +32
Rice (2/2005) +32
Powell (12/2000) +77 Albright (1/1997) +31

And Americans are, to put it mildly, not impressed with what T**** has done for our presence on the world stage. Only 42% of Americans polled believe that the US rates favorably in the eyes of the world, while 57% believe it is viewed unfavorably. A year ago, the numbers were reversed at 54 favorable, 45 unfavorable.

The current view is the least favorable since 2007, at the end of the Bush/Cheney administration. Here are the net favorables provided by Gallup in that decade:

2007: -18 2013: +11
2016: +9 2017: -13

I'm noting a distinct pattern of differentiation between President Obama and the Republicans on either side of him. (Although W did have very high ratings on this question for a couple years following 9/11.)

And speaking of President Obama, let's look at my favorite of all the gifts Gallup is bestowing on us in the past couple days:

Do Americans believe that other world leaders respect T****?

The answer, of course, is a resounding "NO."

Here are the numbers for each of the past 3 POTUSes at about this same point in their first terms, on this question:

Do you think leaders of other countries around the world have respect for the president, or do you think they don't have much respect for him?
GW Bush:
Yes 49%
No  38%    (Net +11)

Barack Obama:
Yes 67%
No  20%    (Net +47)

Donald T****:
Yes 29%
No  38%    (Net -9)

29%. That number seems awfully familiar. Wonder what it reminds me of?

Three weeks in, folks.

We will win this.

This is helpful why?  Republicans do not answer to the American citizens.  They answer to their supporters, the ultra rich, and mega corporations.  Other than in 2 years when the next election roles around, republicans have no reason to give a flip at all about what the people think about them.

It gives heart. Winning big against the map in 2006 was a precursor to 2008.

They will care in about a year if he is still around 40%. They know he will bring down many of them in 2018 if we have a fair election.

Staying that high is improbable.

Of course, a major terrorist attack might boost his numbers. Why that is, I don’t claim to understand. I don’t understand why starting wars boosts approval, either, but historically, it has.

Me, I usually see both of those as failures. In any case, I have no faith that trump’s response would inspire my respect any more than bush/cheney’s did.

It is odd because I have been mulling over the possible effects of the “America under siege” effect with respect to Trump and the Republican congress.  I am really not so sure that historical trends would hold.  I mean, he is the most unpopular president in the first 100 days ever.  The GOP congress had an approval rating of just 39% this past week according to one poll.  I can’t remember what the numbers were in 2006 when Dems won the House or in 2008, but I am pretty sure that they were much higher.

All that congress stuff aside, Trump keeps bucking historical trends and in combination with his quixotic mania that might actually result in his numbers tank if there was an attack or a war.

Because it dissolves moral ambiguities. Like it or not, deep down humans operate on a simple “us” vs. “them” mentality. Having a war, or some kind of attack, provides a clear “them” for “us” to unite against. I’m not saying it’s good, smart, or even correct, but that’s how it is.

I’m not writing for Republicans. I’m writing for the readers of this blog. And whoever they choose to pass the information on to. Americans hate this guy, and if we do our jobs, that can have a big impact in 2018.

And P.S. — the next election doesn’t “roll around” “in 2 years.”

Anyone who sees an election as “rolling around” has already lost it. We need to be working on election strategies right now. Party-building, GOTV, strategic messaging, encouraging/identifying candidates — there is a lot of work to be done.

Understanding and leveraging the rage, fury, frustration, disgust, shock, unity, and enthusiasm of those on our side is a big part of that process.

That’s right and there still isn't a DNC chair in place. I do not think we will make much progress in 2018. I hope to God I am wrong, but I just don't see it.

I’d like to know why f’ing Fox News has had 1 damn poll yet.  They polled the shit out of Obama, especially when he was doing poorly with the public.

Yeah but starting a war for him may not prove to be beneficial. He ran against starting a war (I know, since when does he not renege on him word, but still important to the electorate) and he's got no real chops in this area. A war would likely be miscommunicated and bungled and he's wholly unexperienced in war.

That would depend on who the war is with, really.
