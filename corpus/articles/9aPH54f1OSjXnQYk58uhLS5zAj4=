They’re Back. As if they ever really left. Barack and Michelle Obama have signed with the same talent agency that handled President George W Bush. Nothing particularly unusual about the signing except for the fact that Michelle Obama is included. Most former first ladies don’t go this route, Hillary Clinton being the exception.

From The Hill.

“President Barack Obama and Mrs. Obama have selected the Harry Walker Agency (HWA) to coordinate their respective speaking engagements,” Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said in a statement.

It is common for former presidents and other high-profile government officials to sign with a speaking agency after they leave office. HWA also represents former President Bill Clinton, former Vice Presidents Dick Cheney and Al Gore and former House Speaker John Boehner.

Lewis also announced that the Obamas would manage contract negotiations for possible book deals with Washington, D.C.-based attorneys Robert Barnett and Deneen Howell. Barnett has represented a number of prominent clients, including former President George W. Bush and former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton
The former first lady, Michelle Obama will also be appearing on the reality tv series, MasterChef Jr. as a guest judge, in an upcoming episode. .
