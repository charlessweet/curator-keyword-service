Appeals Court Rules Against Trump's Immigration EO, Upholds Restraining Order

UPDATE: Trump has responded, in all caps.


***Original Post***


The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled against the Trump administration's favor in regards to the president's immigration executive order, which temporarily bans visitors from seven nations in the Middle East and Africa. With their decision, the three-judge panel upheld Seattle Judge James Robart's nationwide injunction against the law.

Two-thirds of the panel was reportedly concerned that the law was intended to discriminate based on a religion.

During oral arguments Tuesday night, DOJ attorney August Flentje pushed back against claims that Trump's order was a Muslim ban, pointing out that the seven nations listed on the executive order originated in the Obama administration. He also insisted that Trump was acting in accordance with the Constitution.

"This is a traditional national security judgment that is assigned to the political branches and the President and the court's order immediately altered that," Flentje argued.

In a speech to law enforcement officials on Wednesday, Trump defended his executive order by reading federal law and urged the appeals court to act fast in the name of national security.

With this ruling, expect the Trump administration to bring this issue to the Supreme Court.
