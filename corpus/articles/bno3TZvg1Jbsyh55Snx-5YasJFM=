MoveOn Launches New Effort To Take Back the Senate As Trump Drags Down GOP Hopefuls
By Brian Stewart. Thursday, August 18 2016
** MoveOn Members Endorse Ann Kirkpatrick (AZ), Sen. Michael Bennet (CO), Maggie Hassan (NH), Deborah Ross (NC), Catherine Cortez Masto (NV), and Katie McGinty (PA) **

Members of MoveOn.org Political Action in six states have voted to endorse Senate candidates Ann Kirkpatrick (Arizona), Sen. Michael Bennet (Colorado), Maggie Hassan (New Hampshire), Deborah Ross (North Carolina), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nevada), and Katie McGinty (Pennsylvania) as part of an effort to elect a Democratic majority in the Senate this fall.

The endorsements come as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump continues to drag down incumbent Republicans and GOP hopefuls with his politics of hate, racism, misogyny, Islamophobia, and authoritarianism.



The endorsements are part of MoveOn’s United Against Hate campaign to defeat Donald Trump and the politics of racism, hatred, sexism and authoritarianism and elect a Democratic-controlled Senate this fall.

Earlier this year, MoveOn members also voted to endorse progressive diplomacy champions Tammy Duckworth (Illinois}, Russ Feingold (Wisconsin), and Ted Strickland (Ohio) in their respective Senate races.

“MoveOn members are mobilizing nationwide to ensure Donald Trump never steps foot in the White House – and show that Americans clearly reject his politics of hate – while helping to elect Democrats who can advance progressive policies in Congress,” said Ilya Sheyman, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action. “Bolstered by leading progressive voices like Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders, MoveOn members will help take back the Senate this fall and continue to fight for progressive change at all levels of government.”

The results of the MoveOn membership votes follow:

• Ann Kirkpatrick, 94% of votes cast by Arizona MoveOn members. Kirkpatrick is challenging Sen. John McCain, who has continued to say he will support Trump despite his relentless attacks against the Gold Star family of Humayun Khan, a U.S. soldier who died in Iraq. See more on this endorsement here.

• Michael Bennet, 64% of votes cast by Colorado MoveOn members. Bennet is an incumbent facing Republican challenger Darryl Glenn, who has continued to support Trump despite his and disrespect towards the family of a fallen soldier, a federal judge, and other minority groups across America. See more on this endorsement here.

• Maggie Hassan, 90% of votes cast by New Hampshire MoveOn members. Hassan is challenging Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who continues to support Donald Trump despite being critical of his relentless attacks against the Gold Star family of Humayun Khan, a U.S. soldier who died in Iraq, and his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States. See more on this endorsement here.

• Deborah Ross, 95% of votes cast by North Carolina MoveOn members. Ross is challenging Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who has continued to support Trump despite the presidential candidate’s repeated attacks on military families and comments Trump made in North Carolina that seemed to suggest violence toward Hillary Clinton, among other offensive attacks. See more on this endorsement here.

• Catherine Cortez Masto, 70% of votes cast by Nevada MoveOn members. Cortez Masto is running for the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Harry Reid and would be the first Latino woman elected to the Senate. She faces Republican Joe Heck, who continues to support Trump despite the presidential candidate’s repeated attacks on military families, immigrants, and other minority groups. See more on this endorsement here.

• Katie McGinty, 94% of votes cast by Pennsylvania MoveOn members. McGinty is challenging Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who has refused to say whether he’ll endorse Trump despite the presidential candidate’s repeated attacks on military families, immigrants, and other minority groups. See more on this endorsement here.

In recent weeks, Trump has continued to fuel speculation that his tanking campaign — rooted in bigotry and hatred, and causing dozens of leading Republican officials to renounce his candidacy — is impacting down-ticket races and could cost the Republican Party their majority in Congress. 538 reports that Trump’s presidential bid “could cost the party the Senate,” and top Republican strategists expressed fears of an “electoral bloodbath” this year to CNN.

In addition to “Take Back the Senate” endorsements, MoveOn members have also endorsed U.S. Senate candidate Kamala Harris (California); House candidates Mike Honda (California 17th), Pramila Jayapal (Washington 7th), and Zephyr Teachout (New York 19th); and Kim Foxx for Cook County State’s Attorney (Illinois).

In the 2014 election cycle, MoveOn members made over 6.7 million phone calls for endorsed candidates. MoveOn members have also raised millions of dollars—including more than $1 million for Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s Senate race in Massachusetts in 2012 and more than $1.2 million for Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign in 2016—mobilized volunteers, and run ads in support of endorsed candidates across the country.

Nationwide, MoveOn members voted to launch a multi-million dollar United Against Hate campaign to stop Donald Trump and keep him out of the White House and ensure the country rejects his hateful and dangerous rhetoric.

MoveOn.org Political Action represents the collective will of MoveOn’s members at the ballot box by helping to elect progressive candidates.
