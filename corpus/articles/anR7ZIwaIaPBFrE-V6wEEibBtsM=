CONGRESS HAS THE POWER TO STOP D.C.‚ÄôS SUICIDE BILL. WILL THEY?

As Washington, D.C., plans to join the six states that have legalized euthanasia, it has hit a possible fatal roadblock: Congress.

In the waning days of 2016, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser signed the ‚ÄúDeath with Dignity Act,‚Äù which had passed the D.C. Council. But because the District is not a state, the bills that pass out of the council are subject to the purview of a congressional review period (even the D.C. budget).

The Death with Dignity Act would enable a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a patient who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and projected, by two doctors, to have less than six months to live.

But conservative members of Congress are raising serious questions about the dangerous loopholes in the bill. Among them is the fact that the bill does not exclude people who can choose to fall within the six-month illness window simply by refusing treatment. Many people with HIV or diabetes, for example, could conceivably receive a six-month prognosis should their treatments cease.

There are also concerns that once the lethal prescription is taken home with the patient, it‚Äôs in an uncontrolled environment, where it might be lost or taken accidentally by someone else (e.g. a child).

Further, there aren‚Äôt effective safeguards against mentally ill patients being prescribed suicide pills ‚Äî or family members pressuring a loved one to end his or her life. With the suicide pills ringing in at $300 or less, it‚Äôs a much cheaper option to end life than to pursue costlier treatment options ‚Äî especially for insurance companies.

If insurance companies, especially government-controlled ones, have a legal $300 physician-assisted suicide option, won‚Äôt they be partial to that option every single time?

And that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happened in other states. Just 11 years after the Oregon Death with Dignity Act took effect, lung-cancer sufferer Barbara Wagner was told that her Oregon Health Plan would pay for a $50 suicide pill, but not the $4,000-a-month cancer medication.

As ABC News reported at the time, Geoffrey Fieger, one of the lawyers who initially advocated for physician-assisted suicide, admitted that Wagner‚Äôs case ‚Äúis hardly unique.‚Äù In fact, ‚ÄúInvoluntary choices are foisted on people all the time by virtue of denials,‚Äù Fieger told ABC News. ‚ÄúI am surprised there hasn‚Äôt been a revolt in this country‚Ä¶.it happens every day and people are helpless.‚Äù

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah (C, 76%) has promised to seek a vote on the D.C. Death with Dignity Act in the House. Reps. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio (D, 61%) and Phil Roe, R-Tenn. (F, 56%) (both doctors) are also pursuing action against the bill, and co-wrote a thorough analysis for National Review dissecting the problems with it. Rep. Wenstrup also worked with Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. (C, 71%) to introduce resolutions of disapproval, which, if passed by Congress and signed by President Trump, would halt the District‚Äôs Death with Dignity Act.

The D.C. suicide bill is a life-or-death matter; the lives of people in D.C. are in the hands of Congress. Let‚Äôs hope they act swiftly.
