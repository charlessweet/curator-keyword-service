If a freshman congressman from Ohio has his way, federal agencies could find themselves relocating outside the Washington, D.C. swamp.¬†

Earlier this month, Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, introduced the Drain the Swamp Act of 2017, which would require all federal government agencies inside the beltway to relocate outside the D.C. metro area by 2023.

‚ÄúIn addition to cost benefits, my hope is that government agencies will reorient themselves to what is most important- the people they serve,‚Äù¬†Davidson said in a press release.

According to the legislation, departments would have to have plans to relocate drawn up by September 2018 and will be permitted to leave no more than 10 percent of their staff in the capital.

‚ÄúI strongly believe that if we can make neighbors of the agency employees and the hardworking Americans we will start to see policies that reflect the needs of our neighbors rather than the wants of Washington,‚Äù reads a statement from original co-sponsor Ted Budd, R-N.C.

Conservative Review met with Davidson at one of D.C.‚Äôs ugliest federal office buildings to discuss his new bill and explain, in detail, what he believes the legislation will mean for the American people and the future of Washington‚Äôs bureaucratic class.
