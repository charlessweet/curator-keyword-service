From the February 10 edition of Fox News' Fox & Friends:

BRIAN KILMEADE (CO-HOST): Let the legal process play out. But he's got so much other on his plate. And, keep in mind, this was an operation to pause in those seven terror-laden states, without stable governments, in order to set up a vetting procedure. Set up the vetting procedure. And, I know it sounds harsh, but really, it's on the courts now. If something happens with these refugees, you can't blame the president. He tried to do what he said he was going to do. He did everything he could, being he didn't really have an attorney general to lead the charge, and then the courts, whether it was clumsy or not, the courts said, "no, I'm not going to do it." Whether it was a liberal court or not. It doesn't matter.
