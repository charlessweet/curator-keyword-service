Politico reports that Chuck Cooper, a former Justice Department official who is close with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, has withdrawn his name for consideration as Solicitor General. The story quotes Cooper’s statement:

I am deeply honored by any consideration that I may have received by Attorney General Sessions and President Trump for appointment as the Solicitor General, but I have asked them to discontinue any further consideration of me for that critically important position

As I noted here, the other leading candidate for the position has been George Conway, a prominent New York litigator who is also Kellyanne Conway’s husband. Unless a dark horse emerges, it would seem that he is likely to be the next SG.

Update: According to this CNN report, in addition to Conway, there are two other prominent conservative attorneys under consideration to be Solicitor General, Christopher Landau and Kannon Shanmugam.
