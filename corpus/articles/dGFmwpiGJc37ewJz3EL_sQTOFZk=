CNBC has just reported on the contents of a memo from Jeb Hensarling, (R-TX) the head of the House Financial Services Committee.  

We all knew that with Trump in office and the Congress in full Republican control, the GOP would be going after consumer protections from all sorts of angles, but the contents of the memo give a sense of just how nasty their plans are.  

For all those Trump supporters who thought their hero was going to “save the middle class,” sorry kiddies.  Better put your money under the mattress.

….Hensarling (R-Texas) is strengthening his attack on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and scaling back regulations on living wills and bank stress tests in new legislation expected to be introduced soon...with some of the biggest changes directed at the CFPB.

The bill would turn the head of the consumer watchdog agency into a political appointee who can be dismissed at will rather than the director of an independent agency, the memo states. The previous bill called for a five-member commission to lead the CFPB.

According to the memo, the bill would strip the agency of its authority to bring cases against financial institutions under a provision known as unfair, deceptive and abusive practices and eliminate databases of consumer complaints.  (Emphasis mine)
(NOTE:  The Living Wills reference is a proposed change to requirements that banks create a document detailing what they would do if their institution went belly up.)

In fighting for creation of CFPB, Senator Elizabeth Warren won an important point.  It would be financed outside the regular budget process.  She knew that once it was created, if it was subject to annual budgets, the GOP would treat it like they have the SEC, FCC, IRS and other agencies….cut staff and resources to weaken their effectiveness.  Changing the leadership of the agency to a political appointee subject to dismissal at will pretty much achieve the same end since a compliant Trump will have little interest in this position or its importance.  His choice of cabinet members from the business community makes that patently clear.

This latest news comes on the heels of Trump administration announcements that they will be attacking provisions of Dodd-Frank, the legislation created in the wake of the 2008 market collapse, caused in large part by fraudulent and risky lending practices by major financial institutions.

Trump is also ordering a half-year freeze in implementation of a requirement that financial advisors tell their clients up front whether the investment recommendations they are making to those clients are based on benefitting the advisor or the client (an important distinction since advisors can often profit handsomely by selling products like annuities, even though such moves may not be in the best interests of the client.)

Consider these pending moves as a group:

The Hensarling memo suggests stripping CFPB of its ability to file cases against financial institutions for unfair, deceptive and abusive practices AND eliminate data gathering on consumer complaints,

The steady growth in fine-print contract and agreement language that forces consumers to resolve complaints only through an arbitration process that heavily favors business.

The increasing hurdles to the creation of litigation “classes” to create class action suits.  (The average consumer under Trump will be facing nearly Herculean obstacles to fighting back against usury, fraud, price gouging and monopoly practices such as those entailed in the Trump University case.)

A new administration whose senior executives have thrived through their use of just such practices from the Secretary of Labor and minimum wage, to Mnuchin and foreclosures, to Price and insider trading of medical stocks.

Changes in banking regulation restoring the right of banks to pursue the kinds of risky lending practices that caused the devastating crash of 2008.

A Justice Department about to be headed by Jeff Sessions and a Solicitor General nominee who is a soul mate of Mr. Sessions, Charles Cooper.   Charlie Pierce at Esquire has to vile details of Cooper’​s legal history.  He would have been a popular lawyer a century ago.

Cooper is a close friend of Sen. Jeff Sessions, the Alabama lawmaker whom Trump has nominated to serve as attorney general, and helped to prepare Sessions for his confirmation hearings. Like Sessions, Cooper could prove to be a controversial pick. In addition to his role defending California's ban on same-sex marriage, Cooper also signed a brief on behalf of the federal government supporting Bob Jones University in its challenge to the constitutionality of an Internal Revenue Service policy denying tax exemptions to religious institutions that discriminate based on race. The university had argued that its ban on interracial dating was based on its sincere religious beliefs, but the Supreme Court upheld the IRS policy, by a vote of 8-1. And in 1986, as the head of the Office of Legal Counsel, Cooper signed an OLC opinion that argued that employers could reject job applicants with AIDS if they were concerned about contracting the disease.
Now more than at any time in modern history, we are going to need a fair and honest court system to protect the rights of consumers.  Now more than at any time in modern history, that system is under dire threat.

Donald Trump has promised he would “drain the swamp.”  He has said his every decision will be based on the needs of “forgotten” middle class voters.  In fact, Mr. Trump is opening one of the world’s most vicious alligator farms, and plans to feed them with the middle class.

Crooked Trump is working hard to make the US a great place for crooked bankers and money folk to be in, because there are no limits on or remedies for crooked conduct that any consumer will have by the time he gets done. The Free market will be free for frauds and dishonest folk of all kinds and ordinary folk will be forced into those markets when he makes SS safe by making it dead and forcing all those savings and SS trust monies converted to vouchers into a market newly full of crooks.

And of course, he will have no responsibility for the day after the elders all get  financially cleaned out. Not his problem. The Free Market’s problem,

As I look more closely at the photo both animals are about evenly matched in weight, but the Eagle is dive bombing the wolf with that straight arm punch to the jaw even as her talons lock around it and from that pivot point  allow the momentum of  the center of mass to rotate around to land on top of and pin to the ground her adversary while the beak comes down slashing, ripping out the animals throat.

And as if all this isn’t enough, they are working to gut anything associated with sustaining and strengthening the national voting system:

Just in case President Donald Trump’s specious voter fraud claims haven’t done enough to diminish public confidence in American elections, House Republicans have set out to shutter the one federal agency that works to keep the nation’s polling places running smoothly.

The mandate of that agency, the Election Assistance Commission, is to modernize and secure the nation’s voting machines, and to serve as an information clearinghouse for states on such best practices as how to avoid long lines at the polls, and make sure all votes are tallied. It’s the sort of thing that one might expect Trump, with his unsubstantiated claims that fraudulent ballots cost him the popular vote, might consider worth investing in.

But this week the Republicans on the House Administration Committee voted to kill the EAC, approving along party lines a bill authored by House Republican Gregg Harper, of Mississippi. Harper declared that, “it is time for the EAC to be officially ended,” adding: “We don’t need fluff.” Harper’s panel concurrently voted to eliminate the presidential public financing system. Reform advocates on and off Capitol Hill decried both moves, calling them antidemocratic.
Probably doesn’t much matter anyway with a new AG who has built a lifetime track record of attacking anyone who tries to assure minority voting rights.

Well, according to the Wiki article on MS-3 (Harper’s district), it’s 64.2% white, 33.3% Black and 1.2% Hispanic (the figures listed on Wiki actually add up to more than 100% which could be due to rounding figures up or the way that Hispanics can be counted among whites or Blacks).  The district is also 59.67% rural.  It also appears that the post-2010 redistricting didn’t do much to change the boundaries—a little tweak here, a little there, but pretty similar to the district that existed prior to redistricting. All three of the GOP districts are R+14, R+20 and R+15 (Harper’s district); the lone Democratic district is merely D+10.  And based on the state’s population, you’re probably looking at a lost cause. 

The State as a whole is 59.1% white, 37% Black and 2.7% Hispanic (the Wiki article listing of demographics doesn’t list Hispanic/Latino as a separate group but, of the 59.1% white, that breaks down to 58% white, non-Hispanic and 1.1% white Hispanic).

Anyway, bottom line is, what we need are volunteers who can go door to door and reach every possible Democrat in the district.  Give Harper a serious run for his money.  Never surrender, and make them spend money everywhere.

“Apathetic, disenchanted and disillusioned democrats/independents...”

Yes, and the proliferation of cynical remarks around here provides numerous examples.  

IMHO the problem is with our own party.  I’ve tried to justify & make excuses for years but the bottom line is, we need serious change.

Look at last year:

The “big excitement” on both sides of the fence was for populism: Bernie’s populism on our side, Trump’s populism on their side.

It’s true that HRC was the most highly-qualified candidate for President in living memory.  It’s true that 8 years of President Hill would have meant major progress on a number of fronts.  It’s also true that 8 years of President Hill would have meant 8 years of peace and calm and no worries about nuclear war or other major emergencies. 

But it’s also true that there was a pervasive _perception_, whether correct or not, that HRC was not “populist,” but instead was too closely connected to corporate interests, or too distant from the working class, the masses, whatever word you want to use for that.

And it’s also true that Trump got a lot of support precisely because he did appeal to “the masses.”   That, plus a nudge from Putin, another from the Moldovan teenagers, possibly Comey, and certainly the MSM’s “look at the monkey!” journalism.

The obvious lesson is that there is a populist mood in the country at large, people feel they’ve been screwed over and then abandoned, and they are bloody pissed and voting their anger.

We can go there and address those voters, and we don’t have to use language that will be seen as “Marxist dog whistles” by corporate funders & big donors.  It’s all about emotional messaging and emotional narratives.  But unlike Trump we don’t have to wink-nudge racism and so on.   And neither should we do the “oh you poor dears” stuff that Democrats so often do: it’s condescending, and it’s disjunct from the emotions of the voters.  Instead identify with the anger, frustration, cynicism, etc., and reflect those feelings back to the voters to show we’ve heard them and gotten the message. 

And then we have to deliver.  Which we can do if our candidates are willing.  And if it costs them Big Money donors, it’ll get them major support from “the little guy/gal” to more than make up for it.

Otherwise we may as well jump in Grover Norquist’s bathtub and drown.

Dallas News Reporter in story today provides an important point about CFPB:

Last week I asked 100 people in an audience, "How many of you have heard of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?"

Only five people raised their hands.

I'm surprised. In the 240-year history of our nation, we never had a truly pro-consumer federal agency until five years ago. It's working, but now we're in danger of losing it.

If you use money or credit, take out loans, buy cars or pay a mortgage, this bureau in Washington, D.C., is changing the way financial companies do business with you.

We might lose the bureau because big and small banks and other financial institutions hate it. They're fighting it in court with lawsuits and on Capitol Hill with campaign contributions to members of Congress who will decide the bureau's fate.
Yet another sad instance of the many GOOD things Dems have done for consumers that are virtually unknown.  I have noted before the absolute stupidity of Alison Grimes running against Mitch McConnell for his KY Senate seat.  Asked if she supported Obamacare, she waffled and wiggled.  She got killed.

The obvious response SHOULD have been, “You are darned right I support it because it gives insurance coverage to tens of thousands of Kentuckians who until now had no coverage and had to go to emergency rooms after waiting far too long to deal with problems that could have been dealt with much less expensively and easily if they were covered.

Many of you don’t know it, but the program called KYnect, is actually Obamacare.  It was the Democrats who got this through Congress despite massive opposition from Republicans and a wall of lies and misinformation about death panels and job losses and soaring costs.

Obamacare now gives Kentuckians reassurance that a major illness won’t drive them and their families into bankruptcy or leave them homeless.  I support it.  Mr. McConnell does not and his party has and continues to do everything they can to kill it….in large part because the Democrats created it and for no other valid reason.  They keep claiming they have better ideas to replace it, but ever since it was launched they have NEVER actually come up with a workable alternative….one that provides reliable affordable coverage for more Americans.

Well, in THAT particular respect, it seems like a lot of Kentuckians didn’t seem to know it either.

I know I read stories of Kentuckians applauding the GOP calls to “repeal Obamacare” and falling in lock-step with the GOP lies about it until they were informed that their very popular KYnect was actually a by-product of Obamacare.  They still didn’t care.  Oh, sure.  They LOVED their KYnect—they just didn’t like the idea of other “moochers” getting healthcare on “their” dime.

Meanwhile, number 45 doesn’t know if it’s good to have a strong dollar or a weak one...or the pros and cons of each situation. Now that is some weak sauce.

The Wells Fargo slap was in September of last year...and only five have heard of the CFPB? This might also indicate just how much people don’t know about the central tenets of Dodd-Frank, in spite of the non-sense about community banks, which have been declining since 1979.

How to resist this:

If you have a mortgage, get it transferred to your credit union.

Credit unions are consumer-owned cooperatives.  Your account is your share, which is your vote for the Board of Directors. 

There is exactly no excuse for progressives keeping our money in bankster-banks when credit unions provide better services, better rates, and a vote in the management of the institution.

Our money in bankster-banks only helps fund the lobbyists who are eagerly waiting to screw us with frozen cactii.

Make no mistake.  I hate cash. It rots.  So, the fact that I’m in it is definitely evidence that I don’t trust this economy right now.  I bought houses as well.  Personally controlled cash flow is the best thing to have right now.

If you can afford to buy “houses” plural, you’re already on safer ground than a lot of us, so the issue is asset protection rather than survival.  But both of those avenues converge in the same place, which is that it’s better to not have money tied up in bytes that live on the Internet.

If Trump hots it up with China, and China sells some of its holdings in T-bills, that is going to get “interesting.”

YES.  That’s how to resist: take your money out of the bankster-banks and put it in a credit union.  We can call this “de-funding the right.”  Every progressive needs to do it ASAP.  (And then we can expect the Trumpists to try to create rules to strangle credit unions, but every time Republicans have tried this in the past, it has failed, and it will fail again and again.)

For years the right has leaned on magical thinking, that regulation is not needed because of a universal force called free market self regulation.  So when that toxic spill gets carried into your basement by a flood caused by extreme weather conditions, the public’s disapproval of the polluter will put him out of business and take care of the problem….

This is just simply the conservative belief that the “free market” is all powerful. In the “free market,” consumers will use their own judgements as to whether products or services are of value, or not, or even if they are harmful. Consumers in the “free market” will be able to rely on the experiences of others in the “free market” to help them make their decisions. This reliance on the “free market” will not work unless providers of goods and services are protected from unnecessary lawsuits brought be consumers of said products or services. So hence legislation like the one cited in this story. It shifts the entire burden of safety and efficacy to the consumer where it belongs, because in the “free market” consumers will learn to avoid shoddy products and services, relying on the experiences of those unfortunate to have gone before them.

Precisely right.  Abortion is THE reason the people at my husband’s conservative church overwhelmingly voted for Trump. They could overlook his lies, his adultery, his deplorable business ethics and convince themselves that he was a true Christian — just needs a bit of polish — in order to vote for him.  And they don’t just say this, they have genuinely come to believe that Trump is God’s choice.   My husband doesn’t talk politics at his church.

I don’t believe a party that only cares about the rights of the unborn and won’t pay the massive amounts of welfare that would be needed to support the severly disabled children born to short miserable lives, won’t subsidize the extra monies needed to support the orphans created by choosing the unborn over the mother, won’t even pay to feed and clothe the children we have now — I don’t believe any of them should call themselves pro life.

They’re anti woman. 

You want the test? If you’re seriously against abortion, get as much free birth control out there that you can. Easy access to birth control drops the abortion rate everywhere it’s been tried. 

Red states won’t try it (for the most part.)

Anti woman- not pro life.

I have also made the Swiftian suggestion that every man gets a reversible vascetomy at 15. I mean if you want to prevent pregnancy and abortion, a woman can only give birth once a year. A man can get some woman pregnant three times a day (if he’s Wilt Chamberlain). I guarantee that will drop the number of teenage pregnancies and abortions.

And once he has a job and three grown women attest to his character, he can get it reversed.

I mean if we’re making medical decisions for other people, let’s be even-handed about it.

Where the fuck is the messaging that Republican constituents in Alabama and Texas and Tennessee etc. are consumers too? Where is the messaging that tells these folks that their elected representatives are actively trying to fuck them over? I think most people, if asked whether their bank or credit card company should be able to steal from them, would say “Hell No!” The CFPB is such an easy sell with the Wells Fargo story as a leading example, and Republicans looking to dismantle the agency are such easy targets — I can’t believe there’s nobody willing to play attack dog on this! The commercial practically writes itself.

Wells Fargo, one of America’s largest banks, had a corporate policy that encouraged identity theft by incentivizing employees to open credit accounts for customers without authorization. Tens and tens of thousands of these fraudulent accounts were opened, resulting in millions of dollars in fraudulent charges and ultimately costing customers tens of millions of dollars -- just so bank employees could meet monthly “goals”.

The CFPB uncovered Wells Fargo’s brazen scheme to defraud its own customers and pursued legal action against the bank, resulting in a $180 million fine and the resignation of Wells Fargo’s chief executive, who had personally championed the fraudulent practices.

If not for the CFPB, Wells Fargo would still be opening unauthorized accounts and defrauding customers to this day. And yet, Republicans are planning to kill the CFPB. They believe ordinary Americans aren’t worth protecting. Republicans believe big banks like Wells Fargo and other large companies should be free to steal from customers and the American people.

The question is, how do we get this across to Republican voters? How can we simplify this power grab in the starkest, most propaganda-proof terms possible? 

And to go a step further, how can Trump voters have a psychological ‘out’ that gives them a place to go other than “we were wrong.”

Yes, folks, Steve Bannon is a stern task master and he is guiding the Trumpeteers to perform changes that will hurt everyone, including those people ignorant enough to have voted for the #OrangeBoil.

If there are investigations going on, of which we’re not aware, into the Russian connection and other illegal and traitorous actions by Trump and his minions, they’d better produce results to remove both Trump and “Cure them by reprogramming” Pence together, and reverse the election.

I know, reversing the election is a pipe dream but trust me, I’ve not had a toke in too many years and wish that I had some weed now!

This should be the next focus of the resistance.  Republicans want to create another financial collapse.  If the legislation looks like it might pass, consumers and businesses should protest by repeatedly moving their money from bank to bank.  This would create a major headache for the financial industry, but would not hurt consumers.  Just keep shifting your money from bank to bank so that they all have trouble meeting their capital requirements for the Federal Reserve system on a day to day basis.  Bankers will beg the congress to stop.

Krugman’s thesis assumes that Trump will remain in office long often to provoke this sort of reaction from people who hate the US to start with. If/when Trump resigns/is impeached, Pence will take over. Not much of an improvement, true, but I suspect Pence will be smart enough not to need enablers like Bannon around & toss Trump’s basket of deplorables out the door. (Of course he’ll install his own, but hopefully slightly more rational than Trump’s.)

Oh, surprise, surprise. The EPA and every other “watchdog” agency will be attacked, weakened, or closed down by these extremists, or more appropriately, “radical governmental terrorists”. Trump’s many neuroses allow him to be manipulated without him even being aware of it. Her thinks he’s the strongman running the country when, in fact (real fact), the real boss is Bannon and the far right wing nuts in Congress. He has no control over his emotions let alone the duties of the president — any know it. He’s a multi-tool meant to be used to hammer, saw, burn, and destroy, but he pathetically thinks he’s the king. Sorry, Bozo, they gotcha an’ they own ya. One whisper and it’s lights out. Trump starts to salivate and wildly Tweet, and Bannon et al sit back and let him take the heat.

I can’t see what the Koch’s find to dislike about Trump. Given that they claimed to have invested nothing in him, they have gotten way more than their money’s worth. I know they financed congressional and senate campaigns, but here Trump is giving them entire departments on a silver platter, gratis.
