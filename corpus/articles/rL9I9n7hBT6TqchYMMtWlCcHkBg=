NO SENSE OF HUMOR. CNN Pulls The Plug On Bernie Sanders After #FakeNews Comment

This is just too funny and it shows that Trump’s constant whacking of CNN as a #FakeNews organization is taking its toll on their already fragile self image.

Today Bernie Sanders was a guest on CNN to talk about Donald Trump’s refusal to comment on a Washington Post report on National Security adviser Mike Flynn’s contacts with the Russian ambassador before Trump was inaugrated. The interviewer is Erin Burnett and it is interesting to note, without Sanders talking, how she both asks questions and then sockpuppets answers for the geezer.



BURNETT: I don’t know if you’ve heard, here’s what he has said, he was asked about this report, about Flynn, on his flight to Mar-a-Lago today, his flight just landed about an hour or so ago, and here’ how he responded.

TRUMP CLIP

TRUMP: I don’t know about it. I haven’t seen it. What report is that.

The report that he talked to the ambassador from Russia before you were inaugurated about sanctions.

TRUMP: I haven’t seen that. I’ll look into that.

END TRUMP CLIP
BURNETT: He says he knows nothing about it. He hasn’t seen any of these reports. Is that a problem?

SANDERS: I don’t know. Maybe he was watching CNN Fake News. What do you think?

BURNETT: You don’t buy it.

SANDERS: It was a joke.

BURNETT: I know it was a joke. I’m saying you don’t buy what he says.

SANDERS: Erin?

BURNETT: Yes.

Pause

I’m sorry, Senator. You obviously don’t buy what he said. You believe he has seen these reports so…

Pause.

SANDERS: I’m not… Are we on?

BURNETT: Uh… it looks like we’ve lost connection with Senator Sanders. So let’s try to get that back up. Do we have him back? Okay, so what we’re going to do is take a break. I don’t want to waste our time.
If nothing else, skip forward to 0:35 where Sanders refers to CNN Fake News just to watch the facial expressions as Sanders is sent off to a digital Gulag.
