UPDATE: I JUST POSTED A STORY ABOUT 4 SEATS UP FOR SPECIAL ELECTION. If we lose them Republicans will only be 20 state legislative seats away from amending the constitution. All of the elections are this month:  Defend our Constitution - 4 of 24 seats we need to protect Constitution up for Special Election NOW
I am working on making a case for pushing for a full slate of candidates in every state for all state legislative races. In that effort, I have compiled some summary data from every state legislative body. That information is presented below, with a few notes of my quick take observations on each of the states.

This is all stemming from my ongoing focus on the frightening fact that Republicans are only 24 state legislative seats away from controlling all legislative bodies in 38 states, the threshold needed to ratify any changes to the Constitution. For details on that issue, and how it would all work please read this post:

Protecting Our Rights by Defending the Constitution - State Legislative Races are Critical

Please let me know if you agree or disagree with any of my assessments, whether or not you share my concerns, and, if you do share them, what do you think a compelling path forward would be.

I am personally leaning toward the idea of running full slates in every state. What are your thoughts? This is meant to spur debate and dialogue, I would love all points of view here.

Also, chime in with your observations about the state you live in! Would love the perspective!

THE DATA BELOW
All 50 states are summarized. Here are brief descriptions of each column header for each table. Let me know if anything is unclear or if you have questions in the comments.

Total Seats — Total number of seats in each chamber.
Needed for Majority — The total seats either party need to hold to maintain a majority in that chamber.
Uncontested - The number of races Democrats do not enter a candidate to compete for the seat.
Contested Losses to Lose Majority - How many seats Republicans need to win from races Democrats are competing in to win a majority.
Democrats - Number of seats held by Democrats.
Republicans - Number of seats held by Republicans.
Other - Number of open seats or seats held by Third-Party.
Next Election - Next year the chamber is up for election.
# Democrats Ran Last Cycle - Number of candidates fielded to compete for seats.
# of Seats Up Next Cycle - Number of seats up for election next cycle. All House chambers members stand for election in same cycle, some Senate chambers vote for half the body each active cycle.
Needed to Flip - Number of seats Democrats must win to swing the chamber to our side.
Democrats Up - Number of Democrats up for election in the upcoming cycle.
Republicans Up - Number of Republicans up for election in the upcoming cycle.

NOTES: We do not contest more than twice the number of seats we need to flip to control all 50 state legislative bodies. Worst yet is we concede 1,293 of the 3.772 seats Republicans need to control the majority of all of the legislative bodies. They are basically 1/3rd of the way there before a vote is even cast.

NOTES: Republicans only need win 10% of House and 29% of Senate races that Democrats compete in to secure a majority. Democrats do not contest more than twice the number of seats they would need to flip to secure a majority in the House and they do not contest in one additional race more than they would need to flip the Senate.

NOTES: Well, it is clear what the main point will be here. Democrats did not contest 52 House races last cycle. You need to win 51 to win a majority. Even if they win every seat, they can’t win a majority. Conceding the majority without challenge is madness and malpractice.

NOTES: Colorado is a critically important state in the fight to keep Republicans from gaining the 38 states they need to amend the constitution. Republicans can add Colorado to their column by flipping just 5 House seats. On the flip side, Democrats need to flip one Senate seat while defending the house to gain complete control of the legislature in the state.

NOTES: I was surprised at how close Connecticut was, this is a vulnerable state for Republicans to gain complete control. Republicans need only flip 4 seats to control the House and 2 to flip the Senate. Dems compete well here, but 26 is still way too many uncontested seats.

NOTES: This is a critical state. There is a special election on February 25, 2017 that will decide the Senate. If we lose that seat, Republicans are only 23 seats away from controlling 38 states. Support Stephanie Hansen’s campaign for this seat today.

NOTES: Having been born in the Detroit area, I am interested in this state. I know gerrymandering has played a big roll in this situation. The decline of support for the party from union households is evident as well. While Michigan Democrats engage and contest in all races, there appears to be a need to really reconnect with voters here. Listen and connect your beliefs to the issues you are hearing from constituents.

NOTES: The Senate is a good target for Democrats. Let’s flip that chamber. Unfortunately, they aren’t up for election until 2020. We compete well there. Again, I think we need to stop trying to sell voters our ideas, and rather, focus on their issues. I do not mean we do not stand on our principles, just focus our campaigns here on the things Minnesotan’s raise on their own. When dealing with skeptical audiences, building a connection by talking about them and their concerns will be far more effective than pushing a set agenda on them. Make it about them.

NOTES: This is one of two chambers up this fall. While reasonably safely Democratic, we must not rest on our laurels on this state. The dynamics seem to favor us. The red hot furor over Trump, a lot of soul searching about not voting and the unpopularity of the Republican Governor make this seem like a slam dunk. Slam dunks are only an illusion in politics. Play sound defense.

NOTES: This state is clearly the result of gerrymandering. The hard reality is that the party is not terribly organized in Ohio. It also did not help that we lost nearly ½ million votes in the presidential from 2012 to 2016 in Ohio. I grew up in Ohio, and did some organizing in my neighborhood and I know the party is a bit of a disaster. I mean this result makes it pretty clear that that has not change. Being such a bellwether state means we ought to focus some serious energy here even though the numbers look very daunting.

NOTES: Living in Oregon, I know feels safe, Portland and the I-5 corridor feel like one of those “blue firewalls”. But I will never forget the sting of Oregonians putting a marriage between one man and one woman amendment into our state constitution in 2004. They had to get a good chunk of vote from our so-called blue wall. If Republicans figure out how to reach Portlanders Oregon can flip pretty quick, particularly since we just elected a republican Secretary of State statewide. Leaving him as the back up if the legislature does not pass district boundaries in the next legislature it is considered in.

They are half way there without trying beyond filing the paperwork. The only good sign is that 18 Republican Senate seats are up, leaving us just 10 of those seats to win to regain a majority. At minimum next cycle is a good opportunity to regain ground.

NOTES: We need to compete. Just scanning the vote totals when Democrats compete they draw around 3,500 votes in the races they lose. While that is not enough to beat the typical 4,500 votes the republican draws, it would add 56,000 to the state vote totals. That is more than half the votes that Trump won by. I just bring this up because it illustrates the impact just competing at the state legislative level can have up ballot.

NOTES: THIS IS A PRIORITY RACE SINCE IT IS UP THIS FALL. If you live in Virginia run for the House of Delegates. Republicans only need to win 7 contested races to secure a majority. Your filing deadline is March 30, 2017. If you can’t run, recruit someone. This is critical. As near as I can tell we have around 55 declared candidates so far, but it is difficult to figure out. If anyone has any info that would be helpful.

NOTES: Washington is a tight state. Given that status, it really is hard to fathom how we end up with 21 uncontested races. Basically passing up an opportunity to gain a cheap seat if someone faces some trouble during their race. We need to contest more of these reaces.

NOTES: Ah, infamous “coal-country”. These folks are not as ideological as we think, they have always been economically distressed, even when things were going relatively well. This is definitely a state we need to take a listen and respong approach to.

NOTES: This is the quintessential case of wear running a full slate of state legislative candidates could have paid dividends up-ballot. Even if each candidate only drew 1,000 votes that would have been 24,000  more Democratic votes which would have given Clinton Wisconsin. Talking to voters matters.

NOTES: We field a god number of candidates for a state considered so deeply red, that is good to see. Although, if we run the same number of candidates in the Senate we can’t flip it even if we win all of the seats.
