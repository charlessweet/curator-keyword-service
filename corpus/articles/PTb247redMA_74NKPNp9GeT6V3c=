BREAKING: 9TH CIRCUIT LIBS RULE AGAINST TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT ORDER

The most liberal circuit court in the United States has predictably ruled against the Trump administration‚Äôs executive order on immigration.


The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals‚Äô ruling fully denied the Trump administration's request to overturn the lower court‚Äôs lawless nationwide stay of the executive order‚Äôs enforcement.

This the same court that previously ordered the state of Arizona must grant drivers licenses to illegal immigrants and has habitually blocked the deportation of illegal alien offenders.

It is no surprise that the federal judiciary continues to ignore American national sovereignty in its quest to overrule the lawful actions of Congress and the president and impose a progressive agenda on the American people.

This legal battle now likely moves to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the fact that the president‚Äôs plenary power over immigration is even being contested in the courts is itself a disgrace.

It is high time for serious judicial reform. Congress can start by using its Article III Sec. II power to strip lower courts of their assumed jurisdiction to grant rights to any foreign national to enter or remain in the United States against the law, except in the case of explicit statutory preemption of the president‚Äôs powers.

This, unfortunately, is a necessary action to combat the liberal takeover of America‚Äôs court system and reassert America‚Äôs sovereignty under the law of nations.

UPDATE: Just minutes after the ruling was announced, President Trump responded on Twitter.
