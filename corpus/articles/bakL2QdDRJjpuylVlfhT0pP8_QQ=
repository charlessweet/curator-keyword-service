Top Dems Demand Trump Relieve Michael Flynn After Reports He Talked Sanctions With Russia

National Security Advisor Michael Flynn discussed the possibility of lifting sanctions on Russia with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before President Trump assumed office, The Washington Post reported this week. The White House denied the claim, but U.S. officials confirmed it as fact on Friday, according to the WaPo editors.

In light of the report, Democrats like Rep. Eliot Engel (NY), who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, are demanding President Trump relieve Flynn of his duties - both for engaging with the Kremlin and for "misleading" the public in the aftermath.


The FBI has launched an investigation into the matter.

Both Democrats and Republicans have been critical of the Trump administration's apparent softness toward Russia.
