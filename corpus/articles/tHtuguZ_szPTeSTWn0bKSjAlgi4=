As The Left Wallows In 'Trump Is Hitler' Hysteria, IJ Review Asked Someone Who Lived Through Nazi Germany If There Are Similarities

As the Left indulges itself in President Trump is Hitler hysteria, Justen Charters of IJ Review decided maybe it was time to ask someone—anyone—who lived through Nazi Germany if there were similarities. Charters interviewed Marion Ingebore Andrews, who said that Trump isn’t Hitler, and that it was the lefty protesters who were reminded her more of the infamous dictator with their illiberal agenda and anti-free speech antics:

"What is going on in this country is giving me chills. Trump is not like Hitler. Just because a leader wants order doesn't mean they're like a dictator.
What reminds me more of Hitler than anything else isn't Trump, it's the destruction of freedom of speech on the college campuses — the agendas fueled by the professors.
That's how Hitler started, he pulled in the youth to miseducate them, to brainwash them, it's happening today."
It saddens me that we are teaching garbage in the schools and in the college. We don't teach history anymore. History repeats itself over and over.
The kids out there today haven't ever lived through a war like I did. I remember sitting in a rock pile, cleaning rocks, to rebuild Germany. I remember eating maple leaves and grass to survive."
You may not like Donald Trump, but he’s certainly isn’t Hitler. Neither was Bush. Neither was Romney. Neither are any Republicans who are running or serving in elected office. Trump won in November—how long will this temper tantrum last?
