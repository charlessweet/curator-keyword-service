In Final Weekend, MoveOn.org Canvassing Tens of Thousands of Voters, Running Ads, Busing Hundreds of Volunteers into Swing States to Turn Out Progressive Voters to Elect Hillary Clinton and Democratic Senate Candidates in 8 States
By Brian Stewart. Saturday, November 5 2016
** The final push kicked off with Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaking to  MoveOn.org members and volunteers in a rallying call on Thursday night.

** MoveOn has nearly 200 field staff focused on recruiting and training thousands of volunteers to turn out voters for more than 1,000 canvasses in eight battleground states, is running a five-figure GOTV digital ad campaign, and employing creative tactics and celebrities to ensure progressive voters turn out and vote for Clinton and Democratic Senate candidates.

In the final days before Election Day, MoveOn.org is doubling down on get-out-the-vote efforts to ensure progressives and infrequent Democratic voters turn out and help elect Hillary Clinton, defeat Donald Trump, and win back control of the Senate through more than 1,000 door-knocking canvasses in swing states, phone banking and texting operations, dozens of buses to bring MoveOn members to volunteer in battleground states, a five-figure digital ad campaign, dozens of cultural and creative interventions, and more.

MoveOn’s effort is one of the largest get-out-the-vote operations in the country, with nearly 200 field organizers mobilizing volunteers to reach out to more than 1 million progressive voters by knocking on doors in and placing calls to battleground states. The major effort in key states — including Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania — is part of MoveOn’s United Against Hate campaign to prevent Donald Trump from winning the White House while demonstrating that hatred, racism, misogyny, and xenophobia are a losing strategy.

Over the weekend, MoveOn’s work will include:

> more than 1,000 door-knocking canvasses in eight battleground states, with thousands of volunteer MoveOn.org members working to turn out Democratic voters who may not otherwise vote;
> nearly 200 paid field organizers, working alongside more than 1 million MoveOn members in swing states;
> dozens of free buses enabling MoveOn members to travel to key battleground states to canvass voters, including a bus chartered by the creators of Cards Against Humanity carrying dozens of comedians from Chicago to Iowa City;
> a five-figure digital get-out-the-vote ad campaign, featuring progressive voices like President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders;
> a massive innovative texting program to help recruit volunteers, with more than 2,000 texting volunteers and an astounding recruitment rate: 40 percent of swing-state volunteers come from a text message recruitment;
> other creative get-out-the-vote tactics, from a video with singer/songwriter Alicia Keys to a Harry Potter-themed ad with Sen. Jeff Merkley to a SwingVoter Go online GOTV game.

As of this week, MoveOn organizers and volunteers have held more than 37,000 face-to-face conversations with infrequent Democratic voters, urging them to turn out and pull the lever for Hillary Clinton.

“My favorite moment was talking to an 18 year old who originally said she wasn’t going to vote and then, after we talked, seemed to really get how important it was to defeat Trump and elect other Democrats,” said Deidre D., a volunteer canvasser in Asheville, NC.



“In the last four days of this election, thousands of MoveOn members are getting out the vote to make sure we defeat Donald Trump and his campaign of bigotry and hatred, and elect Hillary Clinton and Democratic Senate candidates,” said Victoria Kaplan, Organizing Director for MoveOn.org. “We know that face-to-face conversations with voters are the number one most effective way to increase voter turnout, and that’s why we’re unleashing the phenomenal energy of volunteer leaders and the millions of MoveOn members to canvass their own neighborhoods and communities, where they can make the biggest difference.”

MoveOn.org has robust field programs with paid organizers and volunteer leaders in eight states: Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. In total, MoveOn has more than 1 million active members in these states.

“As one of the largest organizations to endorse Bernie Sanders, MoveOn organizers and members are in a unique position to help turn out progressive voters – including Sanders supporters, Millennials, and other key constituencies – who might otherwise consider sitting out the most important election in a generation,” said Ilya Sheyman, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action.

MoveOn members have also voted to endorse Senate candidates in seven of the eight states: Ann Kirkpatrick (Arizona), Patty Judge (Iowa), Maggie Hassan (New Hampshire), Deborah Ross (North Carolina), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nevada), Ted Strickland (Ohio), and Katie McGinty (Pennsylvania) as part of an effort to elect a Democratic majority in the Senate this fall.

“We know that our task is not just to win an election, but to demonstrate that bigotry is a losing strategy and to build power to win on the issues that matter to everyday people: income inequality, police and criminal justice reform, climate change, good jobs, immigrants’ rights, and more,” said MoveOn National Spokesperson and Senior Advisor Karine Jean-Pierre.

Earlier this year, MoveOn members voted to launch a multi-million dollar effort to stop Donald Trump and keep him out of the White House and ensure the country rejects his politics of hate, racism, misogyny, Islamophobia, and authoritarianism. Since then, MoveOn has kicked off a major voter contact effort, opened a rapid-response video lab to produce dynamic content around the election, launched a nationwide Laughter Trumps Hate comedy contest, created an online social media canvassing game Swing Voter Go with noted game designer Jane McGonigal, and published an open letter featuring more than 100 prominent artists standing against Trump.
