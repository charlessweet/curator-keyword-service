Who’s afraid of these ladies? Mitch McConnell, that’s who.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell couldn’t make it a few hundred yards from his airport terminal to a waiting SUV limo at baggage claim without running into angry constituents. Rather than take a few minutes to talk with this handful of women, he took a more cowardly route—jumping into an SUV limo on the tarmac and speeding away.

Watch as Rep. John Yarmuth was greeted with applause and smiles as a cowardly Senator Mitch McConnell scampered away like a thief in the night.

Haha. After flying home, McConnell refused to go through the terminal so he could avoid protesters, while Yarmuth walked through to cheers. pic.twitter.com/NWKhFXtxFD

After he blew off constituents at the airport, they took the extra step of heading to his house to read Coretta Scott King’s letter via bullhorn. All of this even though they’d been warned. They got an explanation. Nevertheless, they persisted.

With today’s Republican party it really is difficult to choose which one you hate the most but McConnell is definitely Top 3 for me.  I wish that the rest of his political career be made one long hellish nightmare.

You are so right about choosing the top 3 villains…….my God, where do you start???  But agreed, McConnell definitely makes the cut.  And they are all, each and very one of them, cowards.  I find them beneath contempt because they are intelligent and know what they are doing, but they have made the deal with the devil.  So, gloves off, everybody!

Please make sure Paul Ryan is in the top 3. He is so affectless and closed off I think he is a sociopath. My congresswoman said he walks around the halls of Congress listening to music on headphones and refusing to make eye contact with anyone.

Jim Jordan (OH-04) (oh, Jim PLEASE go talk to your constituents in Oberlin — bet 90% of the town would be there)(Oberlin is an ultra-liberal stronghold gerrymandered into his district) qualifies for me. Steve King is pretty loathsome. The list is long of potential choices. To think Cheney once seemed like the worst they could possibly offer!

She lives in Harvard Square. I don’t see how that could possibly work out well for right-wing protesters. It is hard to park in that neighborhood, so they would have to come by public transportation and a counter protest could be organized in literally minutes in that neighborhood.

Don’t be afraid of that!   It’s time these politicians got an earful, and the only thing that’s turned around here is that, instead of snickering and encouraging the Tea Party protesters of some years back, now THEY are feeling the heat.   They need to be reminded that they are public servants, who are obligated to answer to their constituents.    Make.It.LOUD.    ;)

Nazis will never pull punches; disarming in the hope that Nazis will play nice is foolish. The forces of the right have shown up at peoples homes many times. Go look up Terry Schiavo in FL.

McConnell is avoiding his constituents. They are his boss.  If he wont meet with them in an open forum and has an issue with them assembling outside his home then he is free to resign.

I didn’t think a turtle could move that fast. Time to keep the pressure on politicians like Mitch. Republicans like McConnell have put the country into this downward spiral.

Exactly.  And the protests need to increase in size.  Visible, growing, and relentless resistance needs to be clearly on display to the world.

It’s clear that most of the GOP are going to following Trump no matter where he goes. They are his enablers and need to understand the extent of the growing rage in this country for their failing to protect and uphold our Constitution.

That’s exactly where the pressure needs to be applied — McConnell and Ryan. Ryan needs to answer, for instance, for a Jason Chaffetz who both fails to do his job, but has lately taken to wild, silly prevarications. He’s the chief ethics officer of the House — that sort of thing is hardly acceptable.

That’s very funny. I hope they run MkKKKonell’s rule 19 attack into the ground- Kentucky sandwiches with tongue, lettuce, tomato and cheese called the Rule 19. Chicken sandwiches called the MCConnell. Late night readings of Loretta Scott King’s letter, etc.

The fringe of the party would throw him under the bus in a hot second.  He knows this.  Which is exactly why he won’t be reasonable, to give them cause to come after him.  Don’t you remember that they labeled him a RINO Liberal within the last year, because of his prevarication about the GOP nominee?  So funny…….and yet, not funny.
