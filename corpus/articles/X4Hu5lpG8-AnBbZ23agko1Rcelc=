Andy Puzder has finally filed his ethics paperwork, clearing the way for him to have the confirmation hearing that has been delayed five times. Donald Trump’s labor secretary pick says he’ll resign as CEO of CKE restaurants, the parent company of Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr.; sell off his CKE stock; and … hmmm.

"I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter in which I know that I have a financial interest directly and predictably affected by the matter" without a waiver from government ethics officials, Andrew Puzder wrote in the nine-page filing, dated Tuesday and obtained by The Associated Press. Puzder is CEO of CKE Restaurants Inc., which owns such chains as Hardee's and Carl's Jr.
Personally and substantially and directly and predictably, at least not without a waiver. Does that sound like a lot of hedging to you?

Puzder's intent, spokesman George Thompson said, is to recuse himself from all matters involving CKE or its parent companies.
But the labor secretary can do plenty that indirectly affects CKE by influencing the fast food industry as a whole.

Also, while Puzder is divesting his assets, he’s not using a blind trust (instead, he’ll put his money in “non-conflicting assets”) and he’s looking for extra time to sell everything off. Not the most confidence-inspiring process, on the whole, though Puzder—like all Trump nominees—benefits by comparison with Trump’s absurd sham of an arrangement for even pretending to avoid conflicts of interest.

Delayed 5 times by incomplete disclosure but it's Democrats that are supposedly holding things up.

He’ll be the Secretary of Labor. That means the workers of America. How can he invest in only “non-conflicting assets”?? What, only companies that don’t hire people?? What a bunch of bullshit.

So while his stock in a fast food restaurant are for sale, he will do his best to kill wages and benefits for fast food workers and other low end retail workers, kill labor rules which would allow workers to easily file for wage theft/overtime violations, etc., making his company more valuable.  Good work if you can get it.

If they’re not dirty, and crooks and liars, Trump won’t appoint them. 

All of Trump’s appointees are as unfit as Trump.

Well, I sure am disappointed he didn't skip out on the gig after all. Let's see how well he survives committee.

If you didn't know, this guy has stated he doesn't believe in a minimum wage or paid breaks. In an investigation, his company was found to be in violation of over 150 labor laws. As Secy of Labor, he is supposed to fight for the betterment of workers. Somehow, I'm not expecting much of that.

I say we give him some extra time to sell everything off.  He can take all the time he wants.  The hearings can wait...
