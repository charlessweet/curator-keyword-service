When a political party loses a big election (especially an election they clearly should have won), and finds itself out of power at every level of government, a debate needs to be had about the future of that party. The Democratic party is having such a debate, but when the frame of the debate is as twisted up as it currently is, we aren’t going to make much headway in terms of finding the best answers.  
Debate framing, bad definitions, and false questions are popular in Washington, DC. For years, I have been bemused by the inside the beltway definition of “centrism”, which consists mostly of being pro-trade deals that benefit big business, pro-cutting Social Security and Medicare, and in favor of helping the big banks on Wall Street soften the few regulations that hold them back. None of these positions have any popularity with the actual centrist swing voters that helped decide this election- or any in the last couple of decades- but in DC circles, this kind of “centrism” has for years been all the rage.
 
The same pundits who define centrism in this manner are now trying to frame the debate over the future of the Democratic party as a debate over whether the party should become more progressive or whether we should reach out to swing voters. The problem with this frame is that the message and issues that have the best chance of appealing to the working class swing voters Democrats lost in 2016 (and 3 of the last 4 elections) is the same one that fires up the Democratic base of young people, people of color, and unmarried women: the economic populism of Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, Bernie Sanders, and Keith Ellison. Those kinds of progressive populist politicians, the Democratic base, and swing working class voters all believe that the system is rigged in favor of the wealthy and big business special interests; they all believe Social Security should be expanded and Medicare should be preserved and strengthened; they all believe in trade and other economic policies that will bring back good paying manufacturing jobs to this country; they all believe in spending a lot more money on infrastructure, creating jobs building and rebuilding roads, bridges, schools, airports, electric grids, as well as adding new jobs in solar and wind energy; they all believe in getting tougher on Wall St, including prosecuting those in the financial industry who commit crimes and breaking up the Too Big To Fail banks; they all believe in taxing the wealthiest Americans and reining in CEO power; they all believe in a higher minimum wage and more rights for workers.
 
And you know what else (speaking of a false debate): progressive leaders and our fired up Democratic base are all pro-business, too. According to the Washington Post and other traditional media sources, the Democrats are at war with progressives on one side and the “business-friendly” wing of the party on the other. But here’s the deal: progressives strongly support all kinds of business-friendly policies. We want for small business and start-ups to be able to compete with corporate conglomerates trying to corner the market, and so we favor vigorous enforcement of anti-trust law; we encourage people to sign up for community based banks and credit unions; we have pushed hard to develop solar, wind, and other energy sources that do not contribute to climate change; we worked with retailers to fight Wall St on swipe fees, and are working with them now on attacking this crazy Border Adjustment Tax idea in the Ryan budget because it is essentially a sales tax that mostly working class and poor people will pay; we are fighting to defend hospitals, especially rural hospitals, from the Medicaid cuts Republicans are trying to do in repealing the ACA; we are working alongside the taxi and hotel industries to keep Uber and Airbnb from destroying millions of jobs, creating major problems in housing markets in big cities, and violating people’s ADA and civil rights; and we are standing with family farmers and ranchers as they fight the big food and pipeline companies that are trying to take away their ability to make a good living.
 
Just because progressives oppose big business from getting sweetheart deals and tax loopholes from government, just because we want to stop overheating the planet with climate change, just because we want highly profitable businesses to pay their fair share of taxes and pay their workers decent wages and benefits, just because we want to safeguard the main street economy from irresponsible speculation by Too Big To Fail banks: none of that makes progressive Democrats “anti-business”. Quite the opposite: we are for promoting businesses that are good members of their community, and want to do everything in our power to help them.
 
Here’s another example of a false debate: having to choose between white working class voters in rural and small town America and the urban Democratic base . For starters, note the issues I mentioned in the 3rd paragraph above: as I said, the base and rural voters have very similar views on most of those issues. While there are enough differences and disagreements on some issues to keep Democrats from getting a majority of rural votes anytime soon, there’s a big difference between losing them 62-38 as the ultimate urbanite Barack Obama did in 2012 and losing them 71-29 as Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Those Democrats who are arguing we should walk away from rural voters and rural districts because we haven’t done well there the last couple of cycles are essentially dooming us to permanent minority status given how rural voters and states are favored disproportionately in terms of their relative power in the House, Senate, and electoral college. And we have plenty of issues we can make a stand on in rural America, including saving rural hospitals from an ACA repeal, saving rural schools from Betsy DeVos’ obsession with urban charter and voucher schools, stopping the Border Adjustment Tax which will be a heavier tax on people in rural areas than in urban areas, and making sure roads and highways and schools are built in rural America as well as urban America.
 
It is worth noting, by the way, that the stereotype of rural areas being all white and conservative is wrong: there are a ton of Democratic base voters and people of color living in rural America. Bernie Sanders did very well in rural America, winning most of the small states outside of the South. Native American reservations are 100% in rural areas. And throughout the Midwest and Southwest are rapidly growing numbers of Latinos in rural America. One example: my home state of Nebraska is now over 10% Latino, with small towns like Scottsbluff, Grand Island, and Lexington being over 25-50% Latino. The percentage of these rural Latinos and Native Americans who did not vote in 2016 was astronomical compared to most other demographic groups, as the Democratic party and Clinton campaign did not spend much money targeting them. I am a big advocate of Democrats doing more to reach out to working class rural swing voters on a populist economic platform, but if all we did was focus on turning out our base voters in rural America, we could cut the margins we lost there dramatically.  
  Democrats need to stop listening to the beltway pundits telling them they need to make false choices. We don’t have to decide between base voters and working class voters: in fact, most of our base are working class people who have been as hard hit by this economy’s heavy tilt to the top 1% as anyone, and populist economic messages work for both base and swing voters. We don’t have to choose between being populists and being pro-business: progressive populism is very much aligned with the small businesses, start-ups, green energy companies, and good neighbor companies that we ought to be helping. We don’t have to choose between rural and urban America, as progressive policies on energy, health care, Wall St, farming, anti-trust, education, the minimum wage, and health care are major assets in both big cities and small towns. Democrats need to stop playing either/or politics and stop having debates between ourselves that don’t make any sense.

All true but our party responds more to the near wealthy and outraged more often. The 20% are the one’s not so concerned with economic issues, they have theirs.

That’s pretty much the Clinton platform in a nutshell.  So what went wrong?  How was so much animosity built up towards a moderate, sensible, highly competent left-of-center politician?   How did we get to the point that five DEMOCRATIC PARTY ELECTORS (!) refused to vote for her?  That’s the question that needs answering.  Why do we eat our own?

Another issue not mentioned above may be the elephant in the room, though, and that’s abortion.   I am convinced that a very significance percentage of the Trump vote was driven primarily by the desire on the part of many millions of religious voters, both Catholics and evangelicals, for an anti-abortion SCOTUS.   If you don’t believe how potent this issue was, you probably didn’t spend much time last year driving in rural American listening to local and Christian radio.  Where were all the millions of women who would turn out to defend abortion and contraception rights?  Largely MIA.  

Are we losing on everything because of abortion, which should be a side issue?  And if so, what can be done about it?

About this:

NOBODY has anywhere suggested that we give up on civil rights or issues of choice and women’s rights.  NO ONE!
Well, almost no one. Or should I say, many, many people— people who describe themselves as progressive— have said exactly this:

To those who criticize it, “identity politics” is a distraction. They see it as what happens when a focus on categories like race and gender becomes so narrow that it discourages intellectual rigor, draws focus away from “bigger” issues like economic insecurity, and breaks potential bonds of solidarity between different groups.

Mark Lilla took this basic view in a controversial New York Times op-ed called “The End of Identity Liberalism.” Lilla fears that American liberalism “has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism’s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing.”

Sanders suggested something close to that in his speech, when he characterized “identity politics” as something Democrats might want to consider going “beyond.” He elaborated on this idea by warning that while having an African-American CEO is a “step forward,” it’s a very limited step if that CEO is also “shipping jobs out of his country and exploiting his workers.”

But to people who actually practice “identity politics,” Sanders is presenting a straw man. He’s describing tokenism — the idea that you need a certain quota of “token” members of marginalized groups for the sake of “diversity,” regardless of whether those members are actually qualified or actually represent their group’s interests.

The very idea of tokenism has some offensive implications, though. And it’s not at all what identity politics are really about.
And then there’s this:

Yet, on the occasion that we choose to forgo “open secrets” and speak publicly about the problem, we have have been told we are “vicious liars,” that we are “informants” or “McCarthyites” or “authoritarians,” that we are interested in quashing “disagreement,” or “debate.” None of us are lying. And all of us are able to identify our attackers, because they are familiar to us. They are people who have done this and similar things, as part of a steady, identifiable, and escalating pattern, for years.

All of us know why it is being done. Because we have been told why it is being done, many times.

It is being done because we have been identified as representatives of “identity politics.” Representatives of feminism, of anti-racism, of trans rights, of disability rights, of queer rights, of movements which explicitly aim for an intersectional approach to both economic and social justice. For these crimes, we have been serially, violently, sexually and continually harassed, with the aim of purging us from our positions or from our own movements, in order to establish a “pure,” exclusively class-based, left.
And this (right here in DKos):

 It isn’t enough just to SAY you think discrimination is a problem before you launch into what you consider “real” problems. Almost 2 million surplus votes for Stronger Together want change as well. And I’m looking to the progressive guys and EW who are stepping up to lead my party wondering if they’ll think we need to go ‘beyond’ Black Lives Matter, ‘beyond’ Immigration Reform, ‘beyond’ Equal Pay or ‘beyond’ Childcare Reform or ‘beyond’ protecting PP or ‘beyond’ Rape Culture discussions to find common ground on infrastructure bills that might bring jobs to anxious Rust Belt guys?! Is this where we’re headed? I hope not.
For something that simply doesn’t exist as a problem, at all, anywhere, it seems a lot of folks seem to have perceived just that way. Many, many people.

I guess they’re all wrong, then, that ‘move past identity politics’ didn’t mean what they thought it sure sounded like— because progressive activism on issues like abortion and civil rights are what get relegated to lower importance when we’re told to focus on economics and class.

In what way are civil rights “identity politics”?  Is there some identifier—skin color, sex, gender orientation, ethnic background, etc.--that marks someone as less worthy of having their civil rights than others whose skin color is different, who are the other sex, whose gender orientation is mainstream, who come from certain “acceptable” countries?

This so called progressives are divisive and subversive. The WWC has not voted democratic since sixty nine when they left the party because of dems pushing civil rights.

You ask:

The whole point of discrimination, which is rooted in bigotry, is that arbitrarily designated characteristics— such as skin color or gender— determine social status, whether someone is deserving of full civil rights, equal opportunity, equal protection of the law. This remains fundamentally, horrifically, the state of out society. People face discrimination, hate crimes, exclusion from full access to economic and education opportunities, and are denied protection if the law, because of how a powerful minority (white heterosexual males) perceives anyone not part of that group. 

Surely you see this, amplified by orders of magnitude since Trump’s campaign and election.

It wasn’t Democrats who dragged the issue out of the shadows. They would have been perfectly happy to never mention it if the Republicans had accepted the status quo. They have spent the last 6-8 years doing everything they can to eliminate women’s reproductive freedom. The idea that we should not fight back is ludicrous — and costly. It cost us the governorship of Idiohio in 2010 and put Taxin’ John Kasich on the national stage.

Amen!  It may be considered a side issue by Democrats b/c equality, fairness, freedom, and human rights are at the core of our being and humanity. But when the opposing and majority party has denied that women have any rights outside of marriage, and very few rights within marriage, then choice is no side issue.  It is THE issue for republicans even though they constantly use the issue of choice for every other greedy, selfish, competitive- (testosterone) driven, poverty-inducing law and program they push, all of which are aimed at making real lives outside the womb unbearable and extremely oppressed so that “we the people” can’t even fight anymore or stand our ground.

It's more a question of framing. The abortion debate is one that locks out a lot of people from voting D. I would think that focusing on the availability of contraception and childcare is something we can and should campaign on strongly. The argument also that I don't see much of is that laws against abortion don't stop abortion. Such laws just make abortion dangerous. The arguments the NRA advances about gun restrictions are effective because they emphasize the supposed futility of gun restrictions. So, although I am completely in favor of abortion rights, there may be room for a somewhat more strategic approach.

That is nonsense; no one is “locked out” from voting Democratic because of this. Anyone who is anti-abortion is an automatic R vote and this fiction that were can somehow win these voters by being “soft” Republicans on some issues has hurt us many times. Remember the Blue Dog Democrats, now mostly a memory? It doesn’t work! In 2010, when the Idiohio Democratic Party told us we had to be a “big tent” and accept anti-choicers, we lost just enough pro-choice women, who were enraged, to lose the governorship. And the anti-choicers never chose to come inside the tent. The only “strategic approach” here is to be 100% for women’s reproductive freedom. Anything else is Blue Doggin’ it.

I feel as though for the past 25 years, we’ve been trying for a “kinder, gentler” approach that tries to finesse the right to have an abortion.  All it’s led to is Republicans trying to give blastocysts rights and trying to ban birth control.  At this point, if we support a woman’s right to control her body, we need to be strong and uncompromising.  If people who would support us otherwise don’t support us because of it, their loss.

What Comey did was discourage just enough possibly Hillary voters or convince enough undecideds that she was too corrupt to support to tip the scales, to either not vote in the former case or vote for Trump in the latter. It was a special situation.

I disagree. Maybe 20-25% of republicans voted for Trump’s offensive, divisive, misogynistic, zenophobic, racist, “I have great smarts and power” bullsh*t personality, but the rest of the republicans, and especially the independents and some dems voted on his platform.  They particularly voted for bringing back jobs and representing workers (who he has cheated throughout his adult life; same with small businesses).  Sadly, they were conned, and many of them that I know regretted their own vote as early as the transition, and more so now.

The majority of the country voted for Hillary even though many felt she was not the best candidate optically. Her optics are a result of a 40+ year propaganda campaign by the GOP and no matter how many drawn-out and frequent hearings and investigations they initiated, she never did anything illegal or unethical. Which just served to further enrage the GOP and keep them spending millions and colluding with Russia to burn her any way they could. Still she won the popular vote based on her platform and GOP lack of proof,  repeatedly. 

But you are partially right. Some people vote on personality or the candidate, no matter how deplorable he may be.

This idea that the “entire party apparatus” got behind her and somehow squeezed out another better candidate is a myth that needs to die NOW. And the howling generalization that “it was obvious to many she could not overcome the public’s perception she is dishonest and unlikable” contains a lot of assumptions that many believe, with validity, are false. “The public”? My, that is broad. I know literally hundreds of people who thought she was both likable and honest. PolitiFact found she was THE most honest primary candidate so why wouldn’t people believe she could overcome that perception especially against the candidate that PolitiFact found to be the most dishonest? To whom, exactly, was this “obvious”? Don’t answer, I know. I have no interest in being dragged back into the primary wars.

I am convinced that a very significance percentage of the Trump vote was driven primarily by the desire on the part of many millions of religious voters, both Catholics and evangelicals, for an anti-abortion SCOTUS.

That could very well be so but I want to point out something I’ve mentioned before.  According to exit polls — and being polls we know they are rough, not precise, but even so — Hillary won over 5 million votes from Evangelical or born-again white Christians (which was 16% of those voters) — while in 2012 Obama won nearly 7 million (21% of this demographic), and in both cycles this group accounted for 26% of the total electorate. What all this suggests is that this religious demographic is not solid Republican in its voting habits — they are reachable, even by pro-choice Democrats — and their numbers are so large that how well we do in reaching them can be a decisive factor (the difference between Obama’s and Clinton’s vote totals in this group is vastly greater than Trump’s margin of victory.)

I agree with you. The article frames the populist issues as if politicians like Hillary, Tim Kaine, Tom Perez, don’t agree with them. They agree with them, they ran on them, they’ve worked for them. There is a false debate, all right, and this diarist exemplifies it. 

It is abortion that is absolutely KILLING us in every other area. And I do not think that we should give an inch on abortion, because I don’t consider it a side issue at all. I consider it a fundamental human rights issue to protect women from the misguided and malignant forces that demonize their bodies and paternalistically take control of women’s decisions. As if they can’t love and protect their own children. It is maddening.

But if we don’t give on something, the polarization will continue. The opinions on this issue are entrenched, and they overwhelm conservative people’s sense and even their values. I saw with my own eyes the religious family men and women turning a blind eye to Trump’s immorality. Because of abortion, many liberal causes like climate change action, health care for all, are demonized.

So, basically, I don’t have the answer for this dilemma. Perhaps a re-framing of the abortion issue, some how, some way.

Rahm Emanuel on moving forward:  

Chicago mayor and Democratic political veteran Rahm Emanuel joined his party’s public soul-searching with a Monday speech in which he criticized fellow Dems for being more concerned about purity than about actually winning elections.
“Winning’s everything,” he said in an address at Stanford University’s school of business, as reported by the Chicago Sun-Times. “If you don’t win, you can’t make the public policy. I say that because it is hard for people in our party to accept that principle. Sometimes, you’ve just got to win, OK? Our party likes to be right, even if they lose.”

Long a bête noire of leftists and progressives, Emanuel defended his tenure leading the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, when he recruited a number of more centrist and hawkish candidates to stand for elections in Republican-leaning states, especially in the South and Midwest.

“I got a lot of crap for recruiting Iraqi war vets, football players, sheriffs, businesspeople. I said, ‘Well, they’re running in Republican districts,’” Emanuel said. “You’ve got to be ruthless enough. We recruited people who matched the districts. If you’re running in a Republican district, you’ve got to get somebody who can win in a Republican district.”

He noted that under his leadership, Democrats won significant victories in 2006 and 2008.
“I’ve never lost an election,” he argued. “Our party likes to be right, even if they lose. I don’t go to moral victory speeches. I can’t stand them.”
I know many people here will disagree and don’t like Emanuel. 

But he wins.  We have to win.

Clinton  went left. She talked about getting rid of the Hyde Amendment.

 She and Bernie were running on the most progressive platform we have seen. Right now there is a debate whether or not Mitch McConnell used Elizabeth Warren to amke her the face of the Democratic party.  Trump tweeted Pocohantas is the new face of the Democratic Party. 

I hope the country is ready for a progressive movement. 

Sanders has been in office for decades yet the Senate isn’t filled  with like minded socialists.

Your right about abortion. I have friends that the abortion issue was a major issue. They think God answer their prayers. 

This is what Bernie Sanders said about the loss in 2016 similiar to what Emanuel said.

Speaking up about why he thinks Clinton lost the election, the veteran Vermont senator and self-described socialist argued that Democrats have become too focused on identity politics and not enough on economic issues.

“It is not good enough for someone to say, ‘I’m a woman, vote for me,’” Sanders said after a November speech he delivered in Boston. “No, that’s not good enough. What we need is a woman who has the guts to stand up to Wall Street, to the insurance companies, to the drug companies, to the fossil fuel industry.”

In his own way, Emanuel touched on the same idea while defending his selection of more culturally conservative or centrist Democrats. “I wanted to take cultural issues off the table and I wanted to present economic issues,” he said.
I watched as the most liberal parts of our party attacked Obama non-stop.

He wasn’t doing enough for the enviroment, Gay Rights, Immigration African Americans and he didn't get a public option. That he caved too often. 

SOme of the critisim was legitatimate but we eneded up with the TP taking over while many of the purist stayed home to punish DC. What happened?

The Republicans extremists took over the House and now everything. 

If some  think that the DNC should be gutted I suggest you  start your own organization and get your candidates elected. I have been waiting for that to happen and it hasn’t. Where are the challenger that can win elections and out Mitchell McConnell? Paul Ryan? Jason Chaffetz? Issa? Hunter? McCarthy? 

Sessions? Walker? Rick Scott? John McCain? Lindsey Graham? 

Why are they still in office? 

Why was it ok to hack the DNC’s email? Podesta’s email? Why was it ok to Sanders and his supporrters that a foreign government hacked our election? 

They accomp-lished what they set out to do. 

Sanders said 8% of his supporters voted for Trump. Trade Deals he thought was the reason. How do you go from Sanders to Trump? At Trump rallies they chanted “Jew SA”. Hate crimes against Jews and Muslims are increasing.

What is really sad is when you look at what Obama did accomplish it’s amazing.   The ACA saves lives.  If you look at the economy its a good economy. 

There are problems and we needed infrastruture bills and joibs programs but

when Obama took over we were headed in the wrong direction.

I don’t understand why we werent standing together to move the ocuntry further forward instead of allowing once again the extremists to take over.

During President Obama’s presidency Gay Marriage is now legal. 20+million people have healthcare that would not of had it.  Lazy? Hardly. I worked with many other volunteers to get the ACA passed, getting out the vote, registering voters on college campuses, libraries, grocery stores, held phone banks on every major issue to get people to call their congress person, to get four presidents elected, put on educational events on the dangers of nuclear plants and a joint event with Move to Amend to get Citizens United overturned.  

Held hundreds of phone banks, meetings and volunteered to go to other states to help. 

If we look  at what President Obama and Nancy Pelosi got done it is impressive. Instead of seeing the glass half full too many like yourself see it half empty.  What I don't understand is why after 8 horrible years of Bush too many voters were willing to let the TP takeover. 

I am not going to post the list of President Obama’s accomplishments here but when you look at what was accomplished  of been protecting our victories and worked harder to move the country forward. What we saw was the same old purity tests. 

The ACA was the first step to a better healthcare system. Now that we are facing losing it look at the protests. 

People realize it is saving lives. I wanted a public option but there was no way I would of voted against the ACA and denied millions the opportunity to get insurance because this time there wasn't a public option. Emanuel is right. If we can't win we can pass policy.  We can't improve and move forward.

There is so much wrong with your comment, it’s hard to know where to begin.  To pick an easy point- Emanuel’s win at all costs approach was tried this last election.  It failed miserably.  And it failed miserably because the people are no longer buying the lesser of two evils options being offered by the parties.  And Emanuel may have won, but who gives a fuck about him (that little narcissistic aside is par for the course for him).  The people didn’t.  They didn’t get much for those wins in the end, did they?  And that is the problem that the party has to fix- it has to stand for policies that put the people first, not business.  It’s the very neoliberalism that Emanuel espouses that has led us to this point. 

I will also point out that Emanuel won not because of his genius, but because of the horror that was W and his wars and his admin’s dishonesty.

The people have rejected the lesser of two evils options offered by the parties.  Trump is the result.  It really could be worse.  If we survive, it very likely will get worse.  But eventually, it could get better.  The two evils paradigm ensures our destruction.   Reinventing ourselves from the ground up at least gives us a fighting chance.  We are more than “not Republican”.  We are more than “not batshit insane”.  And we are finally demanding more from our government than evil or slightly less evil.

The damage was done before this election. Too many voters stayed home during the mid-terms. The TP took over.  Gerrymandering, voter suppression laws and all the other horrible things the Republicans have done in their States. 

 What did we get we are finding out as Trump moves to get rid of everything we had. The people in the streets protesting are trying to keep what we have.

Thanks for the reminder of just how unintentionally (?) misogynist Sanders is. He really let his contempt for women fly there. Luckily he is not anti-choice, which is nothing but a cover for virulent and very intentional misogyny. It’s not about abortion; it’s about disempowering women. And yes, of course they are over the moon about that because at its root evangelicalism is about patriarchy and they love anything that reinforces patriarchy. They don’t give  damn about fetuses.

Coming from a socialist Catholic family, and knowing what they say, abortion is  the key. My family goes nuts over “partial birth abortion” and they aren’t the only ones. In Catholic churches, priests will urge people to vote for the anti-abortion candidate. I’m sure this happens in other churches as well. With the enormous Hispanic Catholic population in Florida, this is an issue we must address. The truth is that Republicans will never outright ban abortion (we know they are probably paying for mistresses to have them all the time) because they always want to have “the dream” of banning abortions to dangle in front of the hopeful religious.

There are fewer abortions when Democrats are in charge and we recently hit an all time low. I’m sure they’ll be going back up again with contraception and education and social services being denied to people under yet another Republican regime.

Those are Republican Catholics. Most Catholics I know don’t find this important, and study after study and poll after poll has shown Catholics are no more or less pro-choice than any other group and have abortions at the same rate. As for Hispanic Catholics, we should not make the same blunder Republicans have and pander to them on abortion because those same polls have found that Hispanics, regardless of religion, are MORE pro-choice than the rest of the country. My guess is that it is because they are very family-centered and a little suspicious of government interfering with the family on this level.

I personally know two couples who voted for Trump entirely on the abortion issue.

Yes, it should be a side issue; it was decided long ago.  But the right wing knows a good thing when it falls in their laps, and the abortion issue is it, in spades.  It’s easy to make people vote against “killing babies”; who wants to kill babies?  I’d vote that way myself if I considered early fetuses to be babies.

So the crucial point is the definition of a human being, or rather when does the life of a human being begin.

Here’s what I want to propose: that the definition of “life beginning” is the same as the long accepted definition of “life ending”: when there are no recognizable brain waves.  I don’t know when that happens during pregnancy.  Could some scientists weigh in here?  Also, how easy would that be to detect?

If we could get that issue off the table (at least for most people; Catholic theology would never go for it), we could concentrate on the other issues Michael Lux is talking about here.

1. It isn’t.  Clinton wouldn’t even commit to “no cuts to Social Security” until the calendar year turned to 2016.  Before that her position was more in line with the centrist idea that we needed to make some cuts via changes to cost-of-living calculation or other via adjustments (but never to resolve the problem through tax increases!)

2. Clinton didn’t make economic policy central to her general election campaign.  The main focus of media strategy and advertising was mostly just “Trump is a terrible person”.  Of course he is, but that’s not an alternate vision.

In terms of her economic track record, there are also major problems that dulled the contrasts with the other party.  There’s only one trade deal in the past 20 years that she didn’t actively and publicly support.  No one believed her anti-TPP position, and there are lots of reasons to question the sincerity of her commitment given her VP selection, remarks from people like Terry McAuliffe, and given her push to keep anti-TPP language out of the party platform.   

It’s better to try to move public opinion on a policy that you believe in, than to pretend to support a position in a way that isn’t credible.  

She made a point of touting her support from “real billionaires” through August-October, which coming from a politician who was already closely identified with Wall Street and the super-wealthy, only served to highlight the distance between her and everyone else.  If you’re running as a champion of the working class, you don’t invite Bloomberg, Marc Cuban, and Warren Buffet, and other rich celebrities as public validators.  If as a politician you have some working class credibility but what to broaden support in the other direction, you might do that, but Clinton’s working class bonafides have never been especially strong.  Less so now than 24 years ago.

I also take issue with the idea that the Democratic “technocratic” approach is great policy or politics.  

The 1933 Banking Act is 37 pages long, but it created a legal structure that made the banking system stable (and much less politically powerful) for the next 50 or so years.  

Dodd-Frank is a massive tome that was written with input from lobbyists and which relies heavily on regulatory discretion.  

Over 30 percent of the rules are still being formed 6 years after the laws passage.  

The law, by design, is complicated, because complexity makes it easier for smart lawyers and lobbyists to find carveouts, create exceptions, to delay implementation, and to ultimately repeal provisions that they don’t like.  That is exactly what is happening right now.  

Combined with the bailouts, there’s a decent chance that the “wonderful” technocratic Democratic law-making will be largely removed from the books within the next year or too.  It took over 50 years to even begin to weaken the 1933 Banking Act.  I doubt there are many who think that Dodd-Frank will have the same kind of staying power.

Even the ACA, which does some good things, is a classic liberal “technocratic” solution to the problem.  The law’s complexity is a byproduct of concessions to the donor class.  The complexity also makes the law hard to understand and easy to demagogue.  

For all the benefits that exist — some which took years to actually materialize — there are also hundreds of things that you have to justify, apologize for and try to rationalize.  Even people who work in the sector struggle to understand it.

Politically, a lot of those big donors who were given a seat at the table and who helped to shape the legislation, also turned around and started spending money the next few election cycles to elect Republicans and overturn the parts they don’t like. 

So you have suboptimal policy that is also dumb politically.  

If you do good policy and practice smart politics, voters will reward you.  That happened for the New Dealers.  In the first mid-term after the landslide 1932 election, they won even more seats.  In 1936 they made even bigger gains.

With the Dems the highwater mark was 2008.  Even if we acknowledge the that the GOP is awful, mendacious and evil (of course it is), it’s hard to look back at the electoral results and say that the party had a firm grasp on the political dynamic.

The Third Way Clinton style politics too, was never predicated on transformational political change or bringing millions of new people into the process.  1996 and 2000, the pinnacles of Third Way style politics were some of the lowest turnout elections in U.S. history.  2016 was closer to those times than 2008 and even 2012.  Clinton’s move to the center and her failure to understand popular anger were major contributing factors to that result.

She virtually lived in Ohio and Pennsylvania — the Rust Belt. The idea that it was HER campaign error was blown up a long time ago. She poured resources into those two states and lost. She didn’t go to Wisconsin and Michigan and lost by less there. She was never ever a “Blue Dog/Wall Street” Democrats — she was the most progressive candidate Democrats have run in recent years and this time of fictional smear made by those on our side was a big part of the problem. Imagining that Sanders was responsible for any good thing she supported and the rest of “Blue Dog” centrism is debunked by the fact that they had nearly identical voting records in the Senate.

It isn’t JUST abortion.  Demographics are changing dramatically in this nation.  More than a few trump supporters deliberately voted for him because of his favorability with white supremacists and their philosophy to “Hold Down” minorities in this nation.  Generally, they fear that white people are going to be much less powerful in the US because the number of people identifying as “white” is declining.  This is especially frightening to white men.  This is the driver behind the “travel ban” Executive Order that trump signed but that was written by white supremacist bannon.  Eventually, that ban would be expanded to stop other POCs from entering the country, even legally.

That is why I keep saying that in the MAJORITY of cases, it isn’t worth the trouble to even speak to white, male rural voters.  This is exactly what they believe; they have a paranoid and unreasoning fear of the future, and nothing and no one can convince them otherwise.  Hillary tried to reason with them by telling them that education and advancement is the key to their futures, but they still want to live in a world where having a white face gets you the highest paying job and the best place at the table, even if you cannot do basic mathematics and cannot spell anything except your own name.  That world is GONE and they now must join the rest of us in being able to actually DO SOMETHING, in actually having some sort of skill, A KNOWLEDGE BASE of some kind.  White men in the US have simply skimmed along on nothing for so long, that now the jig is up with them.  Globalization has taken away their free ride, and they resent the fact that they must struggle with the rest of us.  I don’t feel sorry for them.

No, I think abortion was incredibly insignificant. But racism, xenophobia and misogyny were YUUUGE, and that was what jacked up Trump’s margin in some areas. And not all of it was overt or hostile. A lot of it was what I call “soft racism,” a fear that your comfortable $72,000-a-year (average income of white working-class Trump voter) lifestyle with that big house in the exurban subdivision you’re struggling to pay the mortgage on would be threatened if opportunity were made equally available to all and someone black or Hispanic or female proved to be more qualified than you (or your husband who provided for your lifestyle).

Also, I think your post is peculiar because you claim (falsely) that women defending women’s reproductive freedom were “largely MIA.” They weren’t, but I have also send endless criticism that this was a distracting “side issue” or even a matter of “identity politics,” also untrue, because you cannot have economic justice and income inequality if women cannot control their own bodies.

Re your question,

my understanding is that working class folks from the rust belt — both white and POC stayed home.

In the Rust Belt 5, the GOP’s pickup of voters making $50,000 or less is overshadowed by the Democrats’ dramatic loss of voters in that category. Compared with Republicans’ performance in 2012, the GOP in the Rust Belt 5 picked up 335,000 additional voters who earned less than $50,000 (+10.6 percent). But the Republicans’ gain in this area was nothing compared with the Democrats’ loss of 1.17 million (-21.7 percent) voters in the same income category.

…

Democrats also lost the black, indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC) vote in the Rust Belt 5, with 400,000 fewer voters in this category (-11.5 percent). While disaggregated exit-poll data on BIPOC voters was inconsistently available across the five states we examined, in those places where numbers were available, Democrats saw losses among both black American and Latino voters. Importantly, some of the greatest losses in BIPOC votes were in states such as Ohio and Wisconsin, both of which adopted voter suppression laws beginning in 2012. But even in states with no such laws, such as Pennsylvania, BIPOC turnout was significantly lower this election cycle. In short, more people of color stayed home in the Rust Belt in 2016 than 2012

It’s true there are no such laws in Pennsylvania, but the Republican-dominated legislature did pass a voter suppression law prior to the 2012 election, and it got a fair amount of publicity.  After it was struck down by the court, poll workers were still allowed to ask for photo ID, but voters weren’t required to produce it.   It was, on the face of it, a bizarre outcome, but I would suggest that it had a negative effect on potential voters.  People who weren’t necessarily well informed may not have realized they were required to have a photo ID; others may just have felt intimidated or perhaps turned off by being asked for their ID.  At my own polling place—very white, very Democrat, highly educated (lots of university employees and professionals), relatively affluent—they asked in 2012 and 2014, but not this year.  I don’t know what happened elsewhere, but it may have had an influence in some places.

Yeah.  As if the Republicon platforms in that time period have had absolutely nothing to do with that “largest gap.”  Or the gullibility of voters falling for Republicon lies has had nothing to do with it.

Nope.  You’d just rather blame the DLC (which, for the record, only came along in 1985). 

Let’s just remember a couple of points.  Dukakis lost by a large margin in 1988 (he lost by 8 million popular votes and by 315 electoral votes; he only won his own home state by a 53-45 margin).

And Gore’s loss was almost entirely because of whiny “progressives” who didn’t consider him to be “pure” enough for them.  How’d that turn out for the rest of us again?

And Kerry, compared to Dukakis, did do much better (only losing by 3 million popular votes and 35 electoral votes) and could’ve probably fared much better without all the unwarranted attacks (including the outright lies) against him but a few states also had some state constitutional issues (mainly same-sex marriage bans) that brought out social conservatives.

But go back and look at maps of the districts won by the GOP compared to the Dems in 2000 and 2004.  Rural districts voted for the GOP.  And, in 2012, Obama lost many of the rural districts he’d won in 2008.

But, just remember this little “inconvenient truth”: If the DLC had been as “evil” as you like to portray it, Sanders would NEVER have been allowed to run as a Democrat (at least, not without formally becoming a Democrat).

I just love how all these anti-DLC folks like to overlook how Sanders “gamed” the system for his own personal gain.  He rarely made any real news in the House or the Senate during his QUARTER CENTURY in Congress on ANY issue until he decided to run for President.  Now, of course, after losing the primaries and losing the nomination, we frequently see his name getting reported in the media for his opposition to Chump.  I suppose we’ll see just how genuine he is in the next 18 months:  He’s got to decide if he’s going to run for re-election and, during the Presidential primary campaign, he promised that he would run as a Democrat in any future races.

I do wish people would stop talking about who won a primary, as if that means anything whatsoever about the overall political climate of a state.

Example: A state has 1000 voters.  900 are registered Red, 100 Blue.  In the Blue primary, 40 vote for Candidate A and 60 vote for Candidate B.  In the country as a whole, Candidate A wins and is nominated. The state votes Red in the general.  Supporters of Candidate B then allege that the state would have voted blue if Candidate B  had been the nominee.

Does that make the least bit of sense?

My understanding is that it will be nearly a year before we have enough data to make any analysis.  I am seeing so much conflicting information on the demographics.

Here is a link to a Pew poll that shows that 84% of those polled considered the economy their top issue and showing that Hispanic voters beat the average by 2% as 86% in that group cited the economy as the top issue.

[new]  
inclusiveheart  DaisiesArePretty Feb 11 · 02:43:04 PM
Hardcore in America I estimate to be somewhere between 15% and 20%.  The problem with Trump is that he brought out voters to the polls who had basically no political leadership in political office except in some congressional districts or at local levels and for the most part did not vote.  The last overtly racist national candidate was George Wallace.  Nixon and Reagan both had to greatly tone it down and had to dog whistle which didn’t hurt them, but it also did send the hardcore people into the wilderness to a degree.

Trump awoke a sleeping midget — not a giant — but it was enough to help him.  I do not discount the racist vote in this past election, but I do not believe that Obama created a more racist country than we had before he was president — which is sort of the implication when people insist that racists are all that the other side used to win the election.  In fact, Obama’s polling numbers as an outgoing president illustrate that a lot of people liked him.

It was much more complicated than that one aspect of the election.  The election of 2016 was fraught with all sorts of societal disruption and political upheaval.

Personally, I think that people stuck looking at the Democratic primary as the “history lesson” are missing a far bigger and more important body of information and potentially good guidance for the Democratic Party that would come from analyzing the shifts in the views of electorate overall.

If you stop thinking entirely in terms of parties and focus on issues it is pretty clear that in a lot of ways the Republicans’ positions have lost a ton of support.  That sounds counter intuitive, but on fronts like the economy — Main Street is demanding their due — on Social Security, Medicare and healthcare — people are demanding service, protection and strengthening — on trade — people are asking why everything has to be made in China or Mexico — and even on corruption — people believe that draining the swamp is a good idea — and these views are actually shared across the political divide in impressive numbers.  The fact that Trump was able to fool a lot of people into believing that he gave a shit about them is important, but really only in the sense that it reflects a deficit in our approach to winning hearts and minds.  

The bottom line is that I don’t believe that the “evil” part of America is actually anywhere near as large or insurmountable as you do.  I am not going to elevate them to that level for one thing and for another, I simply don’t believe that under different circumstances with better outreach from the Democratic Party that a healthy number would abandon the Republican Party.

Actually, I agree with a lot of of what you said in this post. Your original response to me indicated something different to me — likely due to the flaw of internet communication.

However, my POV includes things I’ve heard speaking face to face with trump voters —  it’s eye-opening. Are they hardcore racists as in wearing white sheets and burning crosses? No. But they’re racists and xenophobic nonetheless.

They bury it in rationalizations like “Mexicans lower our wages by working for cheap” and “allowing so many Muslims to come here allow terrorists to slip in.” 

And when you add their trump votes to the hardcore racists who crawled out of the woodwork to vote trump in 2016 I think the percentage is closer to 30%.

The utility of identity-based critiques of economic populism to the Democrats’ money wing is well-illustrated by Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed’s endorsement of Clinton — which, as the Intercept discovered, was primarily written by a corporate lobbyist.

The economy being a top issue is not the same as economic populism being the preferred method to deal with the economy.  I for example care about the economy deeply and think free trade is good for the economy, and that is not an “economic populist” comment.

It is the same thing, actually.  If you are a victim of economic inequality and have no opportunity the economy is going to be more of a concern for you.  As I said in another comment in this thread, as a woman I know that I am discounted in the economy and I know that discount is further exaggerated when the economy is bad.  I have experienced that economic downturn effect three times over the course of my lifetime.

In any case, it seems like you didn’t read the links to the polls that I provided to you or maybe you’d kind of see what I am saying here.

As for Lux providing citations of polls which are numerous and plentiful and pretty much all in alignment that the economy is a major concern, seems like there is no reason for him to have provided you with a bunch of links that you probably would not have bothered to read anyway.

So labeling the diarist as a “white mansplainer” is your intellectual response to a spot on analysis you apparently lack the political judgment to understand? The top fifty congressional districts where Hillary’s performance fell off the most from Obama 2008 were nearly all carried by Bernie in the primaries and were pivotal in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Iowa.  African-Americans as a group historically have backed the more establishment candidate in Democratic primaries, even Obama lagged Hillary until he won Iowa in 2008, but their support for Hillary doesn’t mean his message wouldn’t be motivating to them.  Economic Injustice is a very powerful issue for most women of color and unmarried women just as it is for all “battered consumers” who are being run over by the oligarchs and living paycheck-to-paycheck.  Perhaps you are among the fortunate among us who don’t have to worry about such things, if so count yourself as lucky.  We Democrats can carry on our quite laudable fight against discrimination of all kinds AND fight just as hard against economic injustice.  When we perform both tasks effectively we will win even in some of the red states.  Mike Lux is one of our brightest lights.

Now, isn’t it funny — have you heard  the media urging Donald Trump to “govern from the center” or demanding that he make “moderate” appointments since he didn’t even win the popular vote? Uh uh.

Three things right off the bat:  equal pay for equal work; legislated profit-sharing for all corporations of a moderate to large size; and tax fairness.

Tax fairness, starting with the top 2-5% paying their respective share of taxes without any corporate- and wealthy-welfare, for elevator garages built into cliffs, airplanes and their hangers, taxpayer funding for Trump’s never-divested business interests and family members “running” the businesses while we get shafted with bills for Secret Service hours, costs of fantastic resort lodgings and food for the SS, transportation costs for the SS staff and all the related accoutrements necessary for communications, tracking and monitoring, and so much more.

All Sec. Serv. expenses related to the Trumps’ businesses via protected family members or their businesses should be billed to theTrump umbrella business. And since he is known for defaulting on contracts, and business arrangements, bill him an estimated monthly amount for Sec. Serv, that has to be paid to the government in advance, or such services will be withheld from those doing business in his name. Make him pay $ for his refusal to be ethical on conflicts of interests and his refusal to be vetted in any way prior to the actual election. Make the Republican federal legislators pay for their sloppy and vile partisan irresponsibility in letting this disgusting and completely unethical state of affairs happen in the first place. Make them take a look at how much he is costing taxpayers not only b/c of his conflicts of interest and his narcissistic refusal to separate from his companies, not to mention the massive expense of building a wall that is not needed or wanted (esp, by people living on the border), his ego and hate driven investigations of problems that don’t exist, his very expensive EOs that didn’t even go through proper channels b/c there are none in his Admin or Cabinet, and the costs of the chaos, confusion, litigation, etc., to deal with his unconstitutional EOs and their domestic and foreign backlash and all those costs. Make the Republicans face the facts, the costs, and the consequences of their power plays, and explain how they will deal with this isn their oh-so-important budget. It better only be on the wealthy and not on our backs anymore. The 21 Billion for the Wall alone would go a very long way toward providing fair and reasonable healthcare for all, good public schools across the country, investing in safe and prosperous urban areas, ending hunger and poverty. We must make the Republicans resolve the problems they have created by their greedy, selective oppression, and oligarchic agenda. 

NO tax cuts at all for the wealthy or big corporations who give YUGE bonuses to CEOs and key players by shafting workers in any way possible to both put them in and keep them in poverty. No more tax breaks for mega-churches who preach against democratic policies in their services, and form and contribute to big right wing PACs; and also those mostly evangelical preachers are now among the very wealthy, abusing Jesus and using Him as a tool for oppression of human beings esp. the disadvantaged, and for the promotion of misogyny, gag rules and all other forms of religious tyranny. (Jesus was NOT a misogynist even in the misogynistic society of His time on earth).  And no more tax breaks for donations to mega-churches which are run like big businesses with political agendas, but not true Christian churches with not-for-profit missions to help the poor, the long-suffering (women, children, the disabled, and those who are needy in the realms of body, mind and spirit). 

Income inequality is something democrats have fought for decades, and republicans have advanced for over a century. It has led to the Great Recession and the Great Depression and many many smaller but harmful recessions that have followed every republican-made “golden era” of oligarchies. Trickle-down economics have never worked and have usually sparked terrible violence, not by those who suffer at the hands of this oxymoronic idea (they only protest) but by the very hands of the profiteers!

widely agree … but you are drifting into issues that are economically insignificant even though they are politically significant. Tool has been so far the only one (as far as I can see) who came with a proposal set that really would change the way the wealth distributes for the largest part of the population. Criticism that his proposals are financially unsound might be made. That has to be assessed. But other than Tool’s proposals — for those who out of hand say things like 90% marginal tax rate, UBI, expanding Sec. tax base etc .. must be out of consideration — then please, just how would they suggest that the economic imbalance should be redressed?

if politicians just say “we wish for more equal distribution” but never say how they want to achieve it then the common people will rightly conclude that the politicians do not mean what they say.

Intersectionality means we all live in this hell hole together. We need to resist the destructive effect that often comes from fireballs hurled from the so-called left.

AMEN!  Democrats need to quit dicing (way worse than slicing) up the pie. We are a nation of diversity all over. We failed to talk to every state in the union and to talk to the 99%. That is where our true strength is!  All of the 99%, period!  Not dividing it up. And we need to make all the points mentioned by the diarist. This WAS Hillary’s platform and agenda, but she kept singing to the choir and going after the # of votes (which she did win) rather than the GOP rigged EC, and the corrupt GOP and Trump propaganda machines. She also got distracted from her true message, as did many of us, by the outrageous assumption by anyone that such a vile, unChristian (who no doubt had someone buy his prop Bible from a very-used book store), uncharitable (proven lies about his contributions), unkind, unrepentant (”smart”),  defaulting, morally and financially bankrupt, compulsive liar and fact denier, cheater, groper and rapist (with witnesses), walking library of horrible character and personality flaws, pathological narcissist could ever be elected. (WHEW!)  And who can blame her for that?  It was too appalling to even consider by major long-term players in the Democratic party. Well they were wrong; sadly they had more confidence in the sanity and reasonableness of the American people than I and many others had.

There is nothing wrong with the Democratic agenda, we need to sing it loudly and proudly, but we need to speak to and with the 99% everywhere.  And we need to have a FULL-TIME DNC CHAIR who will initiate an immediate 50-state-strategy with the strongest resources focused on the red and the rural states. It is unbelievable to me that we were so passive for so long and ignored this strategy which was very well implemented by our opposition, until the majority of states have become GOP owned in every branch and now the federal government branches as well. 

The road is very long now, and it will be even more littered by GOP corruption and erosion of Constitutional rights,  but WE CAN GET THERE AS THE 99%.

I’d add that in my opinion, a lot of rural voters might be won over if we had candidates for national office who actually had interest in and knowledge of agricultural issues, and who were willing to promote progressive policies supporting small farmers and sustainable agriculture as opposed to agribusiness. This could be tied in to a number of urban voters’ interests, including conservation, global warming, organic food, and even sustainable urban agriculture. It is long overdue.

Guns?  What?  Closing loopholes on background checks is “forcing” something on you?  Really?   Come on, spell it out.  Tell us just what choice you want to make that someone 2000 miles away is preventing you from making.

Hunting?  Huh?  Are you referring to protected species?  Do you feel prohibited from going out and shooting bald eagles or something?  How are your choices as a hunter being impacted by people 2000 miles away?

What to wear?  Another huh?  Just what are you being prevented from or being required to wear?   What to drive?  What are you referring to?  I see all makes of cars and all types of cars from hulking pickups to scary little three wheelers available to buyers and no one forcing anyone to buy any particular one.  Do you mean fuel efficiency regulations?  Well, yeah, things like climate change and peak oil might actually be of interest to people even more than 2000 miles away from since the effects of both are planet wide, not limited to a 50-mile radius from where you live.

How to talk?  What, you want to use words like nigger, slut, faggot in talking about people?  I don’t know about people 2000 miles away, but most of us had parents who washed our mouths out with soap when we used slurs like that.  But I guess times have changed and it’s now fine to say anything you want in public, all in the name of freedom.

I agree with you Howard.  I’ve always respected your opinion.  ‘Too liberal to win’ is the false lesson from the Beltway non-thinkers who haven’t updated since the McGovern debacle.  The swing voters that cost HRC the election had voted once or twice for Obama and for the most part are the “battered consumers”, not racist or sexist or motivated by guns or abortion—that group left us long ago and will never come back.      We can sustain 60-40 losses in rural areas and still win statewide in many purple and red states, but not 70-30 and worse.  We must get these voters back to compete in the Electoral College as well as the House and Senate as Mike says.  It is very difficult for a Democratic President to be successful unless we can also win the House and Senate in these hyper-partisan times.  If we can get the rural/blue collar vote back to 2008 levels we will win again.  Let’s focus on that and if the demographics we hear so much about also materialize, then so much the better.

“Lots" is a relative term. If you are the average voter the fact that annual deportations affect fewer than 5% of those here illegally is a lot more striking than the absolute number. Those kinds of percents are taken as a token gesture at best (and how it is taken is what matters). So they have on the one hand a silly ass who wants to build a wall even they know is unlikely to happen, but at least, they figure, he will do something. On the other hand an administration they see as having done close to nothing and whose vocal activists are asking we do even less. That is the choice these people are making and what they will choose is not unpredicatable from models we have seen here and around the world.

A great example of how easy it is not to make this a false either/or platform for the left is this awesome letter written by Tishaura Jones, highlighted by Walter Einenkel yesterday.

Good post Michael.

You know what else is pro-business?  Single payer healthcare.  It takes a huge burden of managing employee healthcare off the backs of the business.  A new business starting in Canada doesn’t have to face the same management burden that a new business here faces.  Everybody is already covered and the boss doesn’t have to worry about it.

I have long been an advocate for single payer in the US.  I have yet to see a single payer proposal for the US that excludes the business sector for any financial responsibility for paying some share of healthcare costs. Currently private businesses pays on average $12,000 per employee for family care with employees paying about $6,000. Who is going to pick up the tab for the $12,000 business share? Even if there are substantial cost savings (which I doubt but a different topic) there is still a big financial hole that someone has to fill. And that is the reason big business hasn’t embraced single payer.

Dumbo  VClib Feb 11 · 10:27:49 AM
I didn’t say it was free.  In Canada they have an individual portion and a business tax and part of it comes from income and sales tax, too.

But the whole human resources headache of insurance is taken away from new start-up businesses.  If the employee has a problem with his coverage, the boss can shrug his shoulders, because it’s not his problem.

Thanks for the clarification. I think big business has very mixed views about single payer. As you note having the HR burden completely removed would be welcomed. However, I think companies like the fact that they have some control over the insurance plans for their employees, and when they pay for something it’s a program they actually chose.  I think what they fear is paying more, with no control over what quality of healthcare is actually delivered to their employees.

The Canadian system enjoys an overall 45% savings across the board.  I don’t have recent numbers but when the Big 3 Automakers were paying ~$6,000 per employee in the U.S. they paid ~$800 in Canada (with advocates on both extremes wanting to see that eliminated entirely, as a “tax on jobs”), which may explain why more “American” cars are manufactured in Ontario than Michigan.  Same companies, same products, same union.

It also explains why no Canadian politician, let alone political party, opposes single payer.

I am a single payer advocate, but I don’t think the saving we would see would be anything near Canada’s or the rest of the G8. We teach and practice medicine in the US is a unique manner, unlike any other country in the G8, or even G20. There certainly would be savings (like insurance and drug company profits) under single payer, but the real payoff would take a generation, and would need to start in medical school.

There was no way Clinton could adopt economic populism because of her history, her speeches, and her big money contributions.  Doing so required her to attack economic inequality and the disproportionate influence of big money in our political system.  She just couldn’t do that given her history and policies and as a result we lost.

There were strong elements of economic populism in her agenda including a large increase to minimum wage and obviously support of unions — a standing Dem platform plank for decades now.  Her efforts to reduce tuition costs are also economic populism, but again, she didn’t do a good job of articulating these positions instead focusing on wedge issues and walking away from the rust belt far too early. If she’d focused on the parts of her platform that were in step with these messages she might well have won.

Most people here scoffed or simply ignored the warning flags.

And now, I see us saying it’s okay to exclude pro-life women from the women’s march — even though they are key to forming a winning anti-Trump coalition.

Neat trick trying to make it seem like all of the things that kovie was talking about were never discussed before the 2016 election on this site or in the real world.

kovie’s comment would have gotten tons of recommendations — or “5s” at the outset of this site’s existence and well into the decade that followed.

We have been talking about every single one of those issues for many, many years.  Nothing at all to do with the recent primary except for the fact that the recent primary seemed to have changed enough of the participants to make this site a far less liberal spot in the interwebs than it used to be.

No, the Beltway pundits were, and have been, way, way ahead of that. The Catfood Commission, among other things, predated this election season and Beltway pundits always nod their heads sagely when “fiscal responsibility” topics are mentioned. The DC disconnect is particularly acute when it comes to punditry.

Until the Democratic Party can differentiate itself from the neo-liberal “centrist” thinking we will never win any more elections. The last 4 decades of economic inequality has been supported by both parties, no matter who was in the majority. The Republicans are blatant about their bias, Dems have done the same things behind closed doors while distracting us with the “identity” politics, having one position in public and an entirely different one when in private with the Goldman Sachs crowd). And it is this that can no longer be tolerated. Part time Dems undermine our positions, folks as diverse as Cory Booker(who puts up a front in public, but caves to the money men when it counts)and Manchin(who is not really a Democrat at all, he rarely votes for our side because he has no backbone and is in fear of losing his seat) aren’t helping. Pelosi’s “we’re capitalists” shows that even the leadership just doesn’t get it. WE ARE TIRED OF THE CORRUPTION, change or die as a party.

Someone asked me if I knew how hard it was to start a new party(a real people’s party). Well, if the Dems don’t change, drastically, we will get a chance to see. We already have the youths, they will never vote for the present Dem party, especially after the treatment they got from the establishment in this campaign. They will be a good start. They could have been a new generation of lifelong Dem voters, but the short sighted DNC cut them off and threw them away. And the DNC did this to protect their sinecure and allow them to continue business as usual. How did that work out for us? It elected the Gropenfuhrer.

Neoliberalism is used to lump democrats with republicans falsely.  Clinton and Sanders platform was similar/the same on many issues and they voted together 93% of the time.  If neoliberalism is unfettered free market capitalism and social democracy is the antidote, that is one thing, but what other alternative is being proposed?  Communism?  Destruction of all corporations?  Utopian socialism?  The diary above shows how Clinton and Sanders wings can work together on shared goals rather than name calling such as “neoliberalism.”

You’re getting awful close to that ‘3rd rail’, VC.  At some point, the law is going to have to address limits on a person’s “right” to hoard resources beyond all conceivable personal need, and to the detriment of thousands or millions whose basic rights to subsist have been breached.

There is no God-given “right” to hoard.  Hoarding is a dysfunctional behavior rooted in fear of scarcity. Donald Trump, bless his heart, is our current national poster boy for appetites gone wild, appetites that will allow/encourage mass murder, theft, extortion, fraud, all to try to fill the bottomless pit of ‘I want it ALL’.

So you ask who PAYS for “all this”, i.e. who pays for us all to have a not-totally-nasty-brutish-and-short life? We’re all paying, whether we pay for a just society for all or for a cushy life for a few.  WHO PAYS FOR THE DONALD TRUMPS OF THE WORLD? We do. They sure don’t pay their own way.

Current food production in the world would feed 9 — 12 billion souls, if it were efficiently and fairly distributed. As it is, 2 billions go to bed hungry every night, while others’ hearts are seizing up from excess fat deposits. Greed is not a victimless crime, but speaking against it will get you strung up. We, as a species, have a way to go yet.

VClib  jakebob Feb 11 · 02:35:02 PM
I think there are two issues. One is how do we have a more fair distribution of income and wealth in the United States. Clearly marginal tax rates on high income earners can be increased, and I favor that. However, the federal government can’t tax wealth (except for estate taxes after someone has passed away) without a Constitutional Amendment and that seems difficult to do. The 16th Amendment was passed by promising that the federal income tax would only apply to millionaires, and at a very small percentage rate at that. I wonder if the federal income tax amendment could pass today?  Even a modest guaranteed annual income for every legal US adult resident would require doubling the current total US federal tax revenues, and likely more. The problem with the 1% is that there are only 1% of them. Such a significant increase in revenues would have to come from a broad based increase in taxes. I think we are a generation away from that even being seriously considered.

The second, and even more difficult issue is regarding the poor countries of the world. There is no one world government, and no organization that can impose taxes on one country to provide income to another. Even the most affluent countries, like the US, struggle to find enough tax revenues to deal with its own problems of poverty, food insecurity, and adequate and safe housing. How will anyone convince the developed world to further tax their citizens for the benefit of the third world? That seems like an insurmountable challenge.

Even in the comments above I see litmus tests that could doom us. Proclamations that certain Dem factions are now “irrelevant,” etc. The diary is great, but I think the deeper problem to overcome is cultural: too many in the party have decided that anything that looks incremental should be vilified. (How many voices here who now fear a sudden repeal of the ACA contributed to the cynical portrayals of it in the past — all because it was too incremental, helped the industry, etc?)

So, yes, we can rally around the ideas above. But that won’t happen if any and all real-world compromises continue to elicit outrage, zapping solidarity and party energy.  Hopefully President Bannon will serve as a wake-up call to the insidious effects of such cynicism.

The error that progressives make is that they seek that magical message that will maximize their votes. The diarist correctly points out that it should not be a choice between centrism and exciting the progressive base. But then assumes that the Democratic Party will maximize its votes with an economic populist message.

What’s missing in the debate is the role of persuasion. Conservatives use polls to see how they are doing, and then try to persuade the public to their position. On the other hand, progressives use polls to seek the message that will maximize their vote. But the progressive strategy may only work in the short run, while the conservative strategy eventually wins out in the long run,

The reason why Democrats abandoned economic populism is because they got slaughtered at the polls with that message during the 70’s and 80’s. In order for Democrats to win on a populist economic message they must persuade enough people why economic populism is good for the country, not just why its better for the economy, but why it is morally right. Conservatives will argue that economic populism goes against American values and freedom. What is the progressive answer to that charge?

Moreover, there are many progressives, that believe free trade is essentially good policy. Free trade is a measure of how good our relationship is with other countries. Free trade is associated with being open and tolerant to all people in the world. If you don’t like undocumented immigrants, free trade promotes economic growth in developing nations such as Mexico, and reduces the need and desire for Mexicans to immigrate. The question is how do you persuade these progressives to your view point or do you say to voters that would otherwise vote Democratic to switch parties?

Subterra  Edward Song Feb 11 · 09:44:07 AM
That’s a good point about persuasion.  If all a political party does is back positions that poll well then they have let the opposing party define the debate.  I think this is related to the backgrounds common to dem vs. repub politicians.  Democrats are more likely to have a legal background and are used to being confined by prescribed law.  Republicans are more corporate and thus comfortable with marketing science so they appreciate how easy it is to manipulate public opinion.  

I somewhat disagree on the cause for 70s and 80s decline of the party.  Much of that was political realignment induced by the civil rights successes of the 60s combined with the colossal military failure of Vietnam.

Edward Song  Subterra Feb 11 · 10:47:29 AM
There is probably some type of causation feedback loop going on. There was a realignment of politics starting in the late 60s (though I’m skeptical of the deterministic realignment theory). The realignment caused Democrats to lose big, and in response they tried to sound more like Republicans, which caused the whole electorate to shift to the right, causing a downward spiral. Even though Democrats have won the popular vote in the last 5 of 6 elections, Republicans are still setting the parameters of the political election game. 

On the other hand, Republicans doubled down when Goldwater lost in 64. They created think tanks that specialized in persuasion. I believe part of their success is because much of their political personnel have backgrounds in business and marketing. Thus, they have learned how to appeal to the public on a visceral level. Meanwhile, most of the progressive personnel majored in political science or some other field emphasizing Age of Enlightenment reasoning, and are people who started their careers in politics. I looked at every presidential nominee since 1980 from the two major parties. Every Republican started their political career after the age of 35, while every Democratic nominee were younger than 35. Perhaps, there is some advantages of starting a political career later in life.

one answer to that charge is that its nonsense. “American” values are human values, and there is nothing in the desire for justice that goes against human values. That includes economic justice. And economic justice is violated if a minuscule sliver of the population hoards all the wealth to the extent that none else retains any prospect of prosperity. Freedom to fail or succeed is a given, but freedom has its limits where it means damage to the othger, including economic pauperisation. No you are not free to drive the country into economic decline and into a new Dickensian lords and serfs economy. Just as you are not free to shoot people at random. Freedom includes limits to the benefit of the whole. And that is not contentious, that is the simple outcome of elemental reasoning. If “American” (read: human) values are in play here then they mean that the American experiment is based on limits what any one can do to the other, whether it be kings, CEOs, or people with a gun.

Actually, what I want to say is that there are dozens and dozens of issues to be concerned about. Because the left is issue oriented, (and for other reasons) the left is highly segmented. This causes a dilemma for the left because taking a stand on a certain issue is going to alienate some part of the Democratic Party coalition. Thus, there is a tendency among Democratic politicians to use polls to see what their position should be on each individual issue. This may work in one election cycle, but in the long run such a politician loses credibility with the public.

What progressives need to do is see what common threads bind progressives together. They also should use persuasion in support of progressivism itself, rather than just running on a laundry list of policies and positions. This is what conservatives do. They promote and defend conservatism and not just positions on specific issues. Thus, when conservatives go to the voting booth, they ask themselves whether a candidate is conservative enough. In 2016, most did not like Trump’s stand on trade, but he was conservative enough for them. Meanwhile, many progressives (and I really like the term liberal better because progressive became the preferred term when conservatives successfully, by using persuasion, made liberal a dirty term) couldn’t vote for a specific candidate because they didn’t agree with that candidate on a specific issue. 

To you, the use of persuasion is something that arrogant and dismissive people use. But to me, persuasion is used by people who have a vision for the world and have the courage to voice their opinions. That doesn’t mean that candidates shouldn’t listen to the voter, because by listening they can learn more about the world. Nevertheless, potential voters always have the choice to reject or accept candidates. If they don’t like any candidates, then they should consider getting involved in the political process themselves.

I agree in the sentiment that politicians need to stop taking positions they don’t believe in based on polls, I think that’s a large part of why we lost this time around. But we still need polls to tell us which candidates message is going to resonate best and which issues are most likely to result in perception of a job well done. When the polling for the past 20+ years tells us the economy is an issue, we need to take that seriously and address the issue to the satisfaction of the majority who are upset about it.

Economic issues are almost always the number 1 issue on voters mind. Thus, a politician always has to have solutions for the economy. Democrats almost always try to address economic issues by proposing a laundry list of programs that polls well. Unfortunately, its always easy for opponents to poke holes in any proposed economic program.  Moreover, Republicans drive a program’s popularity down by talking about taxes and government inefficiency. They take advantage that potential voters are skeptical that government can work and be used as a tool to make people’s lives better. Democrats have to persuade potential voters that government can be used as a tool to make people’s lives better. That is why in a previous comment I stated that when looking at the trees, voters prefer us, but the GOP has the slight advantage when voters look at the forest. It’s because GOP persuasion takes a forest approach, unlike the Democrats who take a look at the trees approach.

Yes, many voters are hurting in this economy. But you have to take it in context, during every election, there are always voters hurting. What we failed to do was to defend Barack Obama. When Barack Obama became president, the economy was in free-fall and the financial markets were collapsing. The unemployment rate dropped by more than half during Obama’s presidency. We failed to make the case that Obama’s policies helped the economy. We failed to make the case that Republican policies destroyed the economy in the first place. Because we failed to defend Obama, this became a change election, and change meant going in a different direction, not accelerating in the same direction.

In contrast, Republicans faced a similar situation in 1988. A lot of people were hurting in 1988. Despite the economic recovery, homelessness had soared under President Reagan, the S&L industry was on the brink of collapse and needed bailing out, and Wall Street had just suffered its greatest crash in history. Yet, the Republicans convinced the country that the economy was a roaring success, and Bush’s motto became “We are the change.” The Republicans won in a landslide.

This is so true. The key issues that constitute being a progressive have widespread appeal. On issue after issue, the American public agrees with us, including folks in rural areas as well urban and suburban areas. 

There is some kind of strange political disease that afflicts both political parties. Whenever Republican OR Democrats lose an election, party leaders seem genetically incapable of understanding why. They always seem to draw the wrong lessons from political defeat. In the case of Republicans, it’s always that they didn’t go far enough right. In the case of Democrats it’s almost always that they went too far left.

Here’s an exit poll that contradicts some assumptions in this diary:

Terrorism was a crucial factor. The exit poll asked, “Which one of these four issues is the most important facing the country?” Sixty-five percent of voters picked the economy or foreign policy, and these voters went for Clinton. Thirteen percent picked immigration, and those voters went for Trump. The backbreaker was the fourth issue, terrorism. Eighteen percent of voters picked that issue, and they broke for Trump, 57 percent to 39 percent. That gap, fatally, cost Clinton slightly more than 3 percentage points of the total electorate.www.slate.com/…

The chief assumption made by the diarist and much of left pushing economic populism is that the issue of jobs is what drove Trump voters. I challenge that assumption. There are other drivers some of which you point out. One of the biggest drivers of Republican voters are issues around immigration, race, terrorism and religion. The assumption many leftist make is that if we focus on economics people will forget about cultural issues. I see no reason to believe that. Conservatives focus on cultural issues to win voters.

The diarist pitch is correct. I just think it is a lot easier said than done.

As a long-time Clinton supporter, I never thought she was immune from criticism and I joined in as appropriate, e.g. about the dumb creation of a private server.  But a lot of the left-side criticism went way, way too far and turned into an attack on the Democratic Party itself.  What rankled most were lefties who had never lifted a finger for the Democrats coming and and attempting to apply litmus tests on who was or wasn’t a true Democrat.  Folks who want to promote a Socialist candidate or party are free to do so, but should build an honest effort instead of attempting a lazy and dishonest takeover.

That said, I am open to a Bernie-style candidate this time around, if only out of thankfulness for the many Sanders supporters who went all-in for Hillary.  What I hope we avoid in 2020 is some kind of ideological jihad where the neo-Bolsheviks try to run their purges.  Let’s be a big tent and actually win and argue through the rest from a position of strength.  As we are discovering now, there is no glory in defeat, only ashes as we watch the Orange Menace rampage.

I don’t necessarily disagree, but I can’t help remembering the McGovern dynamic in 72. After a disastrous 68, losing an election we should have won (against a deranged person), the angry left picked up the crumbs of the party — and we got wiped out. It took decades of centrism to rebuild.

While never a fan of “purity”, it must be made clear to Democratic lawmakers that the days of business as usual are over. Far too many of our elected officials and their supporters continue to insist on doing the same old things that have been proven to be failures time after time after time. It's apparent that the people that make up the party base have moved on, largely leaving elected Democrats in the dust. They can catch up or they can choke on the dust but either way, things are never going to be the same as they were prior to November 2, 2016.

For the people who wish it could be, get over it. It's in the past. The people have moved on so you must decide what you are going to do because the people are not going to turn back to what they’ve left behind.

Politically, the problem with the argument is that your version of ‘economic populism’ WAS on the ballot this year and it got beaten decisively even among a primary electorate much more liberal and receptive to it than any general election electorate would ever be.     You don’t increase broad electoral appeal by moving to less popular positions that lost more badly….it just doesn’t work that way.   Never has.  This argument would’ve had a lot more credibility two years ago when it was mostly untried and untested.   But Sanders’ defeat used that particular block of credibility up. 


Policy-wise, the problem with the argument is that no one has a friggin clue how too bring back the lost jobs — especially when we are standing on the brink of more massive, society-changing job losses due to AI and automation.   Clinton did campaign on a very progressive (and highly aggressive) slate of mitigation policies — things to help the job loss victims survive.   But according to the populists her failure was due to the fact that they don’t want ‘help’ — they want the ‘jobs’.



Well the jobs aren’t coming back and again — no one has any plan to bring them back.    So if you can’t offer solutions you offer blame — and both candidates did that this time.  

Our ultimate political problem is that there simply is no mass of voters out there in the middle willing to buy our ‘blame it on the rich’ argument (no matter how right and factual may be) over the Republican’s ‘blame those people’ argument.    

That framing — ‘blame the rich’ vs. ‘blame the people not like you’ really was the fundamental difference in economic messages offered by the Trump vs. Clinton campaigns.    And we learned that our populist message is resoundingly more popular overall, but their populist message is immensely more popular in white rural areas.   

I’ve yet to see any of the so-called economic populists who want to reshape the Democratic party to chase white rural voters offer any ideas to get around the three-headed factual dilemma that this election re-inforced:

There are no ideas to bring the jobs back — everyone knows this.
Selling blame beats offering non-existent solutions — people at least see it as more honest
Blaming ‘the rich’ doesn’t sell as well as blaming ‘others’ with that target audience.  (Never has, never will.)

Well argued. I have been saying for a long time that “middle America” is far more left wing than the Democrat or Reptublican politicians like to think. Rec’d to bring more eyes. If you haven’t seen this, you might like this chart, s3.amazonaws.com/… They polled likely voters — Dems, Reps and Indies — and found 79% support the government negotiating drug prices, 74% support ending tax loopholes for corporations that send jobs overseas, 70% support expanding Social Security and green jobs, 65% support eliminating the Electoral College (and this poll was taken before the last election), and so on — the majority support most progressive positions when you don’t call them that, and a plurality support the rest (44% support eliminating private prisons, for example, while 37% oppose and the rest either don’t know or didn’t answer the question).

Yet another screed that conflates “progressive economic populism” with “working class populism”.  The two are not the same, in fact, they are diametrically opposed on many issues.

Such as:

Keystone pipeline

Coal jobs

Minimum wage

Wall Street regulation

Progressive economics and Trump economic populism are opposed on each of the above issues, but working class, at least WWC, went for Trump’s brand of economic populism, not the progressive brand of economic populism.

Hillary ran on the most progressive platform in US history.  She even let Bernie and his supporters like Cornell West write her platform.  WC, particularly WWC, rejected it.  They rejected an increase in minimum wage, rejected student loan debt relief, rejected free in-state college, rejected strengthening Wall Street regulation, etc.

About the only “progressive” economic position WC adopted was to clamp down on Pacific trade, but even that wasn’t a “progressive” position, since protectionism has historically been a right wing philosophy, and Trump’s version was SO extreme and irresponsible (a 45% tariff on China, a 35% tariff on Mexico, which would be disastrous for the US), that there was no way to get to Trump’s “left” on that.  Hillary would have been better off arguing the ills of Trump’s extreme protectionism rather than adopting protectionist-light policy.  There’s no way to win an argument when one adopts a <insert characteristic here>-light stance to argue against the extreme version.

Trump’s “economic” populism is based in bigotry, not in progressive economic theory, and THAT’s what appealed to the rust belt working class and rural voters.  Sooner progressives realize that, the better.  Adopting Susan Sarandon’s polices won’t win WC votes.

It is all well and good to talk about economic populism, and I agree that that needs to be front and center to the Democrats’ platform going forward. However:

-How are we going to reach voters whose singular issue is abortion? We can have the most pro-middle class candidate we can think of, but we are not going to win fierce pro-lifers’ votes without outright capitulation on that issue.

-How are we going to reach voters whose singular issue is guns? Someone who wants to maximize gun privileges for all white males is very unlikely to ever vote for Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.

-How are we going to reach voters whose singular issue is favoring police enforcement polices that target people of color?

These issues and many more are not minor problems. These are fights that have absolutely nothing to do with, and let’s just say it, white middle-class economics. And if that triggers you or anyone else, then that’s too bad, because I am done apologizing for standing up for what’s right to the base of my own damn party. DONE.

Pundits are talking to each other from inside a bubble where questioning received wisdom is not done. 

Watched David Brooks insist, last night, that because DeVos’s perspective“ on education was within the policy framework espoused by Trump, we shouldn’t question her nomination. (Also that the fact that she was even questioned was entirely due to the Democratic “base” of teacher’s unions.)

It was nonsense and yet Judy Woodruff nodded her head thoughtfully. Shield pushed back, but only to a degree.

Fighting with pundits is a battle we can’t win. We don’t have the standing, in their eyes, to challenge their perspective on how the world works (or how it ought to). And… this attitude is prevalent, IMO, among our elected representatives as well.

And what is rarely mentioned is what any policy’s effects have on people; it’s largely about optics and “which side” is winning. 

I think direct pressure, in the near term, is the answer. Long-term?  Messaging outside the system already exists, but it’s not coherent/comprehensive AND I don’t think it reaches our reps. Some Dems at least are paying lip service to their base now, but without sustained daily pressure, I envision them waffling back to the status quo.
