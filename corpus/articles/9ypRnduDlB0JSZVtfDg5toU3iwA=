WHY THE BIASED NY TIMES GOT THEIR 'NOW THEY'RE DEPORTING HER' HEADLINE SO VERY WRONG

The New York Times published a story Wednesday about a Mexican woman facing deportation under the new Trump administration and its broadened definition of ‚Äúcriminal alien.‚Äù ‚ÄúShe Showed Up Yearly to Meet Immigration Agents. Now They‚Äôre Deporting Her,‚Äù read the headline, which quickly gained viral traction on social media.

‚ÄúNow They‚Äôre Deporting Her‚Äù became the battle cry and justification for social justice vigilantes fighting President Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúhateful‚Äù and ‚Äúunjust‚Äù policies.


There‚Äôs only one problem: If you actually read the piece, you‚Äôll quickly learn a few things about the 35-year-old woman, Guadalupe Garc√≠a de Rayos. For starters, she has been living in the United States illegally for 21 years. Back in 2008, she was caught using a fake Social Security number. And in 2013, a judge issued a deportation order for Rayos, which never materialized under the open-borders Obama administration.

From the Times:

The Obama administration made a priority of deporting people who were deemed a threat to public or national safety, had ties to criminal gangs, or had committed serious felony offenses or a series of misdemeanor crimes. Ms. Rayos did not fit any of these criteria, which is why she was allowed to stay in the United States even after a judge issued a deportation order against her in 2013.
First of all, Obama did not make an effort to deport criminal aliens, as evinced by the many cases of suffering family members whose loved ones were killed by illegal aliens. Secondly, it seems exceedingly generous that Rayos was allowed to remain in the country even after she was issued a deportation order.

The criticism here is that Donald Trump wants to prosecute individuals who break the law, whether they kill someone‚Äôs child or not. Rayos may not have threatened anyone‚Äôs safety during her 21-year-long stay in the United States, but by making no attempt to obtain citizenship over the course of two decades, she was stealing from the American people.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre living in a new era now, an era of war on immigrants,‚Äù said Ray A. Ybarra Maldonado, Rayos‚Äô lawyer, after leaving the Phoenix Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices Wednesday.

Not exactly. Guadalupe Garc√≠a de Rayos isn‚Äôt getting deported because she‚Äôs an immigrant; she‚Äôs not getting deported because she has brown skin. She‚Äôs getting deported because she broke the law and isn‚Äôt a citizen of the United States. And it should have happened a long time ago.
