MoveOn.org on Rex Tillerson’s Confirmation by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
By Brian Stewart. Monday, January 23 2017
Statement from Anna Galland, executive director of MoveOn.org Civic Action:

“Rex Tillerson, as former CEO of Exxon-Mobil, has a long record of making deals with dictators and despots and putting the interests of Big Oil over the values and well-being of the American people. Making matters worse, Tillerson’s cozy relationship with Vladimir Putin and his long record of denying climate change raise serious questions about his willingness to be the international representative that the American people deserve.

“We stand with Senate Democrats in the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations who showed strong leadership in unanimously opposing Tillerson’s appointment–the first time a nominee for Secretary of State doesn’t have support from both parties in decades. Now, all Senate Democrats must work to delay Tillerson’s Senate floor vote with every Senate tool available to them to ensure he gets a thorough rigorous vetting from the American people. Resisting the Trump Administration’s assault on American values should be the Democrats’ top priority. When they stand up for us, we will stand with them.”

More than 139,000 people have signed a petition from Greenpeace on MoveOn.org’s site calling on the Senate to reject Tillerson’s appointment.
