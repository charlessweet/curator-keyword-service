The complete chaos, corruption, and incompetence (ok maybe not so much with the corruption), is beginning to worry some people at the universal domination headquarters of Goldman Sachs.  Goldman Sachs has infiltrated the Executive branch so much that even Vladimir Putin is jealous.  A bit of a heads up to the Goldman people, when Putin gets jealous of his opposition he doesn’t give them a golden parachute and retire them.

Some at the Goldman death star are beginning to openly worry about what’s happening in the W.H. division.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists led by Alec Phillips wrote in note published late last week. "One month into the year, the balance of risks is somewhat less positive in our view."

…

"The recent difficulty congressional Republicans have had in moving forward on Obamacare repeal does not bode well for reaching a quick agreement on tax reform or infrastructure funding, and reinforces our view that a fiscal boost, if it happens, is mostly a 2018 story," said Phillips. 

…

"Some of the recent administrative actions by the Trump Administration serve as a reminder that the president is likely to follow through on campaign promises on trade and immigration, some of which could be disruptive for financial markets and the real economy," Phillips concluded.
Now, when you’ve got that many people working on the inside of this regime, you get more information than what the public hears.  Having the insider trader advantage may not even be that great since everyone in this White House has pissed off everyone else so much that their coming jobs creation program may consist of additional journalists to handle the flood of leaks that is gushing from them and a giant food taster program for the White House staff and Trump family.

So the Goldman boys are getting shocked on a daily basis by what they hear from their W.H. division.  And now as they look forward to the GOP infrastructure plan (a corporate tax cut and give away lied to the public as an infrastructure plan) the Alarm bells must be sounding again.

Mr. Cohn also argued that the bold infrastructure projects that Mr. Trump envisioned would need private-industry partners, those people said, in order to avoid weighing down the government with costs.

That got Mr. Trump’s attention.

The president-elect turned to the other people in the room — his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon; his chief of staff, Reince Priebus; and Steven T. Mnuchin, his campaign’s chief fund-raiser and Mr. Trump’s nominee to be Treasury secretary — surprised that his infrastructure ideas had such a potential downside.

“Is this true?” Mr. Trump asked the group, according to those people. Heads nodded. “Why did I have to wait to have this guy tell me?” he demanded.
So even though the Democrats have been screaming for over a year that the GOP infrastructure plan was going to be a give and take between the government and corporations, ie the government will give and the corporations will take, our business in chief tycoon didn’t even understand how the infrastructure plan he campaigned on was going to work.  But lest you should be worried that Goldman Sachs may suffer because of the chaos and incompetence in the W.H., hold your tears.

Still, Mr. Cohn’s 26-year career at Goldman, where he performed an array of jobs, including trading commodities, running mortgages and eventually overseeing day-to-day operations, ended with a remarkable windfall: cash and stock valued at $285 million.

Ms. Warren and other critics, who have raised questions about Mr. Cohn’s communications with Goldman employees on policy matters since joining the government, find that sum objectionable.
Insider trading in the stock market is a serious crime, if you’re not in one of the three branches of government and your name is Martha Stewart, but when you’re a giant bank/casino and you’ve got the ultimate insider seat at the GOP W.H. where decisions can move the entire market up and down, that’s called running the country like a business.

RESIST!

They’re shooting for 1932.

2008 and 1929 they can repeat in their sleep.

But the kinds of recovery they were demanding by 2009, they couldn’t apply because they’d been thrown out of power just as the crash was passing through Max Q. They’d had the chance after 1929 which happened after years of Republican government, but at the beginning of a new Presidency. In 3 years they tripled the original market losses into the global Great Depression.

I thought that was the whole idea? Screw the financial markets and the “real” economy! If Goldman Sachs is worried about Trump policies I’m happy, why couldn’t we have caused them indigestion eight years ago and demanded some heads on platters for coming so close to destroying the world economy and causing so much hardship on broad swaths of the public.

Well why did our own party help give them the chance in the 2000 financial deregulation? Jeez there were even some conservative Democrats objecting to that move.

There’s more reason than just Trump that Republicans won this year. Industry deregulation, media deregulation, financial deregulation, and trade deregulation all were passed, some of them signed, by Democrats.

Never forget the basic lesson of Wall Street — they make money when you buy the stock and they make money when you well.  Goldman worried?  Nah, not unless you’re one of the peons flogging the phones.  The execs?   Also remember  — Wall Street authors its own PR — another win-win for them.  It’s a great biz if you’re total interest is being so greedy that nothing is ever enough.  They. will. make. money. 

What to watch for?  Look at insider trading among the Wall Street firms which will precede the next crash.  Just like changing their ownership structure from the partnership format to public ownership.  THAT was how the partners made so much money at the expense of the suckers who bought the shares.  Those suckers, if they stayed long enough, made up their losses.  The suckers this time won’t be so lucky.

They spend a lot of time and energy making sure the ‘risk’ is taken on by the little people and the upside goes to them. Doesn’t matter what happens they will get their cut. They own a very large chunk of the Government and they write the rules.

The entire so called t***p effect on the market is a chimera of greed and naivete', pushed by saavy industry insiders and sold to deplorables as their slice of the pie they were promised.

The likely t***p effect will be exploding deficits, then inflation ( anyone check the price if oil lately ) a slowdown in economic growth because of extreme uncertainty, then lower job growth. And a possible t***p inspired terror attack, isn't even factored in to this reasonable scenario.

The big money boys at Goldman have their doubts for VERY GOOD reasons, and no doubt will be banking a ton on the decline as well.

It ALWAYS pays to have legal inside information.

Just like every bubble Goldman participated in, we told them well ahead of time that this was a bad idea, and it would end up costing investors billions.

Only an idiot could not see where P(ennsylvania Ave.)resident Trump is taking the economy. So if you joined him, you better have wanted to see financial collapse.

Goldman can make just as much money during a collapse. And Trump openly said he also can make money in a financial crises. They're well on their way to repealing the law that was designed to prevent a future collapse, so I wonder why anyone would bet against a crises?

Bloomberg:

By December 2006 a group of Goldman traders and executives… decided to “get closer to home,”.... They’d do this by creating a complex series of trades that would vastly reduce Goldman’s long exposure to the mortgage market and position the firm, in the course of six months, to be net-short, thus benefiting financially if the mortgage market collapsed. The wager worked magnificently. On July 25, 2007, for instance, Goldman’s bet resulted in a one-day profit of $51 million.
Some interpreted Broderick’s e-mail on May 11, 2007 [Goldman’s decision to mark down the prices on its portfolio of derivatives such as CDOs and synthetic CDOs “will potentially have a big [profit and loss] impact on us, but also to our clients.], as Goldman driving down the price for many illiquid and hard-to-value mortgage securities at a time when the firm had implemented its “big short”—thereby sticking it to those who were exposed. A range of Goldman’s counterparties, from Bear Stearns to American International Group, have argued subsequently that in 2007 Goldman began manipulating the price of these illiquid securities, knowing full well that it alone was in a position to benefit because of its short position.

The real issue is volatility, traders, and trade facilitators, do not make as much in a static or stable situation.  The need people and agencies shifting money back and forth in wild swings and bubble/burst cycles to make the most as they take a bit of each trade.

Not sure about the bail out.  Remember, the house Republicans in 2008 were willing to crash the entire worlds economy into a great depression rather than eat the shit pill of a bail out that saved the world.  They were in the minority and caught a lot of flack from their Tea Party crazies.  This time, they won’t give in, and not even GS will make money in a full blown depression.

Well, my take is that this is basically about a bunch of smart crooks and sociopaths worrying that a bunch of dumb crooks and sociopaths will ruin their annual double-digit profit increases, nothing more. There is no moral or long-term perspective here, just pure concern over the firm’s near-term profit outlook post-Trump. I’ll take whatever might pit any major power and money center against Trump, but they are not our allies or friends, and have their own interests in mind 100%.

You only need 1 person from an organization like Sachs to get the inside information you need. Of course, having more is useful for actually making more kinds of policy.

The complete chaos, corruption, and incompetence (ok maybe not so much with the corruption)
“Not so much with the corruption”?  The only reason Trump ran for president, other than to get back at Obama’s digs at him at the White House Corespondent’s dinner, was to profit from it.  There is no question in my mind that Trump’s coziness with Putin involves a large amount of money, and I’m sure that’s not the only scam in the works.

Trump has always been a brass-plated fraud.  No doubt the Goldman Sachs guys started their entreaties when it became obvious Trump was going to become the nominee.  He would be their ticket to big tax cuts and reduced regulation for the financial industry.  But did these smart boys never think to look under the hood to see exactly what kind of lunacy was driving the campaign?  That’s one monumental dose of denial there.

If trump ever faces a downfall it will be because of stuff like this.  He will ignore protests, the republicans will ignore protests and push through their agenda but when, like in Ancient Rome, the senators and rich people can't take it anymore then a ‘scandal’ will arise to take him out.

In my paper today

What could be the “new news” that crashes today’s stock market?

How about a trade war, the expulsion of the U.S. from the World Trade Organization, an international boycott of American goods, or an international boycott on travel to the U.S. Since 41 million — one in five — U.S. jobs depend on foreign trade, any of these could burst the stock bubble….

[Extended list of Trump actions creating uncertainty in global finance]

...No one knows where all this will lead. What we do know is that uncertainty and the stock market don’t mix.

My recommendation: Sell your stocks (and your long-term bonds, too) until the dust settles. If your stocks and long bonds are in retirement accounts, transfer them to short-term Treasuries.

Lawrence Kotlikoff. Gave serious consideration to making a third party run for President, back in 2012. Our local “personal finance” columnist recently retired, but had long touted Kotlikoff (and co-authored some books with him), and apparently was influential in getting him a try out as his replacment, so I’ll be seeing a lot more of his work. Will be interested in how that develops. He’s a regular contributor at Forbes, is clearly not a Trump fan, but isn’t a “progressive” either.

President Trump has started his new school of economics — Stupid Economics.

No thoughtful person would denounce TPP when leading trade economists says it’s, on balance, a terrific deal for the U.S. (OK, it needs some tweaks here and there, but you don’t scrap something that is strongly in our country’s interest. What we’ve learned from Trump is that he is good to his economic delusions. If left to his own devices, Trump could leave our country with few or no trading partners and, in the process, endanger 40 million U.S. jobs. No reasonable person would attack NAFTA without overwhelming economic evidence (of which there is none) that it has harmed our country more than it has helped.

Interestingly, Lloyd Blankfein was on the BBC talking up “growthier” as the prospects for the US economy just this past week.   So, is this a matter of pump and dump?  Interesting….

I don’t think it’s possible to buy credit default swaps against the Trump WH and if you can’t hedge your bets, it’s time to get out.    GS is figuring out that Agent Orange is bad for business.   GS is horrible but if they help to force out DJT, that’s fine with me.
