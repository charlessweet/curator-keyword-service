Join us at the 2017 NRI Ideas Summit as we seek to reinvigorate the conservative movement.
Since the early 1990s, at first National Review, and now the National Review Institute, has gathered leading conservatives — business leaders, policy makers, writers, officials, lawmakers, academics — to join with NR readers and supporters for an intense few days of assessing the movement, gauging its strengths and weaknesses (cultural and political), and forging a way ahead to improve the prospects of liberty in the face of a relentless assault by leftists, multicultural fanatics, and social-justice warriors — and their allies in legislative chambers and the halls of bureaucracy.

The gatherings — Idea Summits — are smart, intense, fruitful, and invigorating. And there’s occasional laughter.

This year’s NRI Ideas Summit will be held March 16–17 in Washington, D.C. (at the Mandarin Hotel). NR readers, subscribers, and supporters of the Institute and its exceptional programs and fellows, are welcome to attend.

These affairs are always works in progress right up until the moment the registration desk opens for business. So while there is a lot more to come — and I’ll be updating as the more . . . comes — here’s what’s planned so far:

There will be panels on


 The Way Ahead

 What Is Conservative Foreign Policy?

 Conservative Economics in an Age of Populism

 Getting Right on Immigration

 Hollywood and Popular Culture

 Conservatism and the Class Divide

And there will be a number of featured speakers — to date we have confirmations from Arizona governor Doug Ducey, Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, and columnist Charles Krauthammer. But we expect several more big names to participate, and we do mean big.

We expect several more big names to participate, and we do mean big.
There will also be a special event: Scheduled for the evening of Thursday, March 16, is NRI’s Inaugural Whittaker Chambers Award Dinner. Named after the great writer, early National Review essayist, and author of Witness, considered America’s most famed intellectual foe of the organized Communist threat, the Chambers Award will go to a conservative who has exhibited a consequential “profile in courage.” The recipient will be British MEP Daniel Hannan, who fought relentlessly for over a decade to make “Brexit” a reality for the citizens of the U.K.

It will be a special evening.

More “to date” information: Confirmed Ideas Summit participants include (and we’ll take this alphabetically) Ed Conard, Charles C. W. Cooke, Kristie de Peña,​Veronique de Rugy, David French, Mollie Hemingway, Andrew Klavan, Mark Krikorian, Larry Kudlow, Kathryn Jean Lopez, Rich Lowry, Heather Mac Donald, Andrew C. McCarthy, Jay Nordlinger, John O’Sullivan, Ramesh Ponnuru, Reihan Salam, J. D. Vance, and Kevin D. Williamson.

Yes, there are many invitations outstanding.

You will find information on how to register, which we hope you will do now, right here.

— Jack Fowler is the vice president of National Review.
