Ahhhh, LARRY BUCHANAN and KAREN YOURISH, you two have done a great job of trying to normalize the insanity that has become the White House press briefing.
Instead of the blatant institutionalized lies in the press conferences.
Instead of the outright attempt to delegitimize the press through bullying and intimidation.
Instead of using the White House press conference as a means of disseminating propaganda.
Instead of using the White House press conference as a means to defend the conflict of interest of the Trump family.
Instead of mentioning the defense of lies about our elections and fantasy illegal voters.
Instead of all of this the big news from you is that Spicer has… changed the calling order. Oh, and he uses Skype.
And let’s not forget you two managed to work in a disparaging swipe at the amazing SNL skit.

I would have replaced the NYT headline words “shaking up” with the words “making a mockery of”.

Sean Spicer is making a mockery of the White House Press briefing with his non-stop pushing of disinformation, his attempting to legitimize fake news sites such as Breitbart, and with his disingenuous labeling of legitimate news sources, such as CNN, “fake news”.

Sean Spicer has absolutely no credibility whatsoever.

Maybe Spicer promised them a scoop on Trump’s upcoming White Water investigation.

I think Karen Yourish and the New York Times graphic desk have done some pretty impressive work.

I don’t know a whole lot about her. But I have a general sense of respect.

I concede — the graphics are very well done. The problem is they, and the article, ignore what the real story is.
