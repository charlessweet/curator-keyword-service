Clarification about nationwide protests and MoveOn
By Nick Berning. Saturday, November 12 2016
We’ve seen false reports circulating on on right-wing blogs and in right-wing media outlets known for inaccurate reporting that MoveOn.org is organizing protests taking place across the country this weekend. Those reports are incorrect.

In addition, we have seen false ads on social media sites purporting to be from MoveOn offering payment for protestors. Those ads are fake, and were not placed by MoveOn. We are not hiring protestors.

In fact, MoveOn members organized peaceful gatherings in more than 200 locations across the country last Wednesday night, with the following message:

PEACEFUL GATHERINGS OF SOLIDARITY, RESISTANCE, AND RESOLVE
MoveOn members and our allies will gather peacefully tonight, November 9, in cities and towns across the nation. We will affirm our continued rejection of Donald Trump’s bigotry, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and misogyny, and we will demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the America we still believe is possible.

MoveOn has not organized any gatherings, or any other events or protests, since Wednesday evening.

That said, we want to be clear that while we are not organizing protests this weekend, we support all Americans’ First Amendment rights to lawfully, peacefully, and nonviolently protest and make their voices heard. Free speech is protected by the Constitution and is crucial to the functioning of democracy.

Moreover, we support the message that most protestors are carrying this weekend: that they reject racism, sexism, xenophobia, and policies that harm the economically disadvantaged, and that they will stand up for communities at risk of being harmed by the dangerous and bigoted agenda that Donald Trump and Republican members of Congress ran on — an agenda that was rejected in the national popular vote.

We will organize together in the weeks and months ahead to strongly and peacefully resist that agenda.
