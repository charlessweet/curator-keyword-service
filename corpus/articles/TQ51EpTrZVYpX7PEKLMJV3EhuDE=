Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has chimed in on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision to block President Trump's immigration order. She sent this simple tweet after the unanimous ruling came out.


Commence Twitter's epic response. Instead of gloating about Trump's losses, social media users suggested Clinton be more reflective of her own.



Trump also offered his response via Twitter, telling the 9th circuit judges that he'll see them in court.
