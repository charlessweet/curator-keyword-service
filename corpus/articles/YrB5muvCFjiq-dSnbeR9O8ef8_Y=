While the world is paying attention to theatrical battles over President Trump’s executive orders and cabinet nominees, a largely unnoticed and potentially landmark case sits before the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. A petition for a writ of mandamus seeking to nullify the results of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election sits on the SCOTUS docket.

A petition for a writ of mandamus is a filing imploring a Court to take mandatory action in the nature of public duty. The writ – filed Jan 18, 2017 by Diane Blumstein, Donna Soodalter-Toman, and Nancy Goodman – has been assigned docket number 16-907.

The main argument for the writ is that, per Article IV § 4 of the U.S. Constitution, it is the job of the federal government to keep U.S. territory safe from foreign invasion. The Constitution stipulates, “The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion.” The petition cites evidence of such an invasion, namely the Russian hacking, and asks that the entire 2016 election be nullified, all the way back to the primaries, on the grounds that cyber-territory in the U.S. was invaded with the intention of altering the results of our Presidential election. The petitioners seek an entirely new election.

Per Title 28 of the U.S. Code § 1251, SCOTUS has “original jurisdiction” over cases like this due to the involvement of a foreign state. There is no remedy for the foreign cyber-invasion, they argue, other than complete nullification.


Docket Number 16-907
“I knew there was a strong legal argument for this, and we had cases prepared in several states, but we decided to consolidate all of our efforts into this one case for the sake of judicial efficiency,” said Jerroll Sanders, who wrote the petition for the writ of mandamus and served as national legal strategist for the group REVOTE. “There is a chance the election could be ruled invalid due to the mountain of evidence that we were invaded with an intent to sway our election. If we are able to argue this case, I think we can win it.”

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence recently declassified a report detailing the Russian hacking with evidence that Vladimir Putin personally ordered an “influence campaign” to sway public favor in the direction of Donald Trump to influence the results of the U. S. Presidential election.

REVOTE‘s website states, “As the leaders of the free world, we cannot allow an adversary to invade our territory and subvert our republican form of government. If other nations such as Austria and the Ukraine held a revote after Russia intervened in their election, so should we.”

A response is due from SCOTUS on February 21 with an answer as to whether the Court will hear oral arguments in this case. The fact that this petition for a writ of mandamus is being considered is quite remarkable. SCOTUS estimates that just 0.01% of cases filed with the court are granted plenary review with oral arguments, so the odds are stacked against this case being heard, but the writ is on the docket and they hold out hope that the odds are in their favor.

Note: To avoid any confusion, it should be noted that the same petitioners initially made a separate filing, unrelated to the Petition for a Writ of Mandamus. They filed an Application for a Stay of the Presidential Inauguration with SCOTUS, which was denied. This separate filing was heard by the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Massachusetts, and denied by Circuit Court Judges Lynch, Kayatta and Barron. The petitioners appealed the Application for a Stay to SCOTUS, but it was denied by both Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg. This application should not be confused with the current petition for a writ of mandamus being considered by the court.

This is all completely unprecedented, which is what makes it so interesting. The petition before the Court requests a revote on both the general election and the primaries. It’s a sound argument, but I don’t know how SCOTUS will view it. The fact that it was docketed and not denied, though, is very remarkable. The response from the court is due in 9 days, so we’ll just have to wait to see what they say!

Yes, the chances of oral arguments being heard is 0.01%, but if there is public awareness raised about the case, it might at least increase the likelihood of a thoughtful response from SCOTUS. These are interesting times. Regardless of this case’s outcome, we do have to deal with the question of whether cyber-territory within our borders counts as U.S. territory to be protected under the Constitution.

Your last point is worth a major legal discussion-our cyber-territory. I can see a need for a definition of our territory to extend to cyberspace. Our airspace, and obviously our territorial borders, are legally defined. Yet a centralization of cyber protection wouldn't be a satisfactory answer; who's to say in future elections a centralized database hasn't been tampered with? It may be that only a legal marker of significance would protect the necessary complexity of our election processes.

This will have the same fate as the suit in 2009 to challenge Obama's eligibility to be president. Similar to the expectations that the Electoral College was going to overturn the election.

It was docketed by a Clerk, rather than being denied. Chances of success are VERY slim — but it was docketed and not immediately dismissed.

Who appointed Ford?   I think that would be the remedy…  A purple president instead of an orange one.   Pence would be out of the loop but I think they would appoint Paul Ryan and that scares me just as much but exactly what he is waiting for.   He is in line for succession.   Of course if they nullify the election that would take away the majority in the house and senate ...maybe.   Crazy.  It would save the republic but they aren’t that bold or brave...Clinton would not get it…..but until we get the hacks and info out about what Russia did in 16..we have the same problem….this is not an easy fix and we are in one helluva mess.

Ford was appointed by the President who had stolen his very narrow first election by negotiating with hostile foreign powers against the United States, during the campaign, to embarrass the incumbent Democrats. He then turned multiple agencies of the federal government against the press, activist groups, citizens and elected officials. Then broke into Democratic Party headquarters in an attempt to steal the re-election that he had been legitimately winning by a landslide. When his Vice-President had been caught in criminal activity in his home state, he resigned, and this President appointed Ford on condition of receiving a full pardon if the impeachment investigation went against him, which it did. And accordingly the President did get his pardon after resigning.

That’s how we got President Ford.

I don’t know which is potentially scarier: the politically easy choice to reject this writ or the politically explosive choice of accepting it and forcing a revote. If the latter happens Trump voters will, probably literally, lose their damn minds. That is scary.

On the other hand, if the writ is rejected, it could mean that foreign hacking of our elections is pretty much ok from that point forward. If the language in the ruling is not very specific to the circumstances of this election, it could encourage countries to interfere on a regular basis.

Shouldn’t change what decisions are made. We can not give in to terrorists, including those that are fellow citizens. Doing so only emboldens them to try to grab even more power.

That said, I don’t think there’s any chance at all of this even being noticed beyond it’s quick rejection. I’m not even sure I agree with it (there are other reasons Trump should be removed, including his mental state).

This petition is going nowhere, so that’s not a concern.

But who is to say that won’t happen if the Democratic candidate wins the next election and Trump refuses to concede, claiming rigged and illegal votes? Polls are showing a frightening number of insane morons are believing the insane claims of Trump and his cronies.

Should we allow 300 million people to remain as hostages out of fear of terrorist militias? That’s not going to be any better than the violence.

I wish. Unless there is compelling, provable evidence of the Russian collusion issue, I would be very surprised whether the Court will even hear a case based on a writ of mandamus. I hate to say this but the Court has to weigh the fact there is Congressional means to undo the will of the people. It is called Impeachment so I would bet even if there was a case to be made under that writ, the Court would defer to elected representatives to remove the president.

Out of curiosity (and concern) how would the Supremes look at it, do you think, if they could at least be convinced that Congressional remedy would be unlikely or impossible due to the corruption and manifest sedition of the “Republican” Party?  And how could their own conservatives and Federalist society B.S’ers be convinced when they have been part of the malaise and destruction of our institutions and our democracy? (They were the ones who actually further enabled R election fraud by unilaterally gutting critical aspects of the Voting Rights act, i.e.).

It’s the attacks from the enemies within, that made whatever the extent of Russian collusion, so damaging. And that hasn’t even been acknowledged yet, let alone investigated to establish provable evidence. What legal recourse is there for the United States, given conservative, fundamentalist destruction of decades and centuries of progress and justice, itself?

Yet again, with this past election and all the crap leading up to it, I am shocked and saddened by the fragility of our democracy. And disgusted, by the irresponsibility and rank selfishness of all too many members of our species.

To be fair, it would seem that the SCOTUS needs to be briefed on what is actually known about the full extent of Russia’s involvement, right? And when they come out of that briefing with their eyes popping out, Then we’ll see.

This is just silly and makes us on the liberal side look stupid and frivolous.  There is no basis for SCOTUS to overturn the election.  Stick with the achievable — save the planet, save ACA, save Medicare, no ban no wall, get rid of Flynn, investigate the Trump’s involvement in Russian efforts to influence the election, 100 more.

If there were some provision in the Constitution for a “do-over” election, then I’d have more hope. Alas, there is not.

The only mechanism to stop this is/was the electoral college — to avoid “they tyranny of the majority” — and it failed miserably. That’s water over the proverbial dam, now.

Raising awareness and keeping the topic alive IS good, though. We can’t drop the ball on Russian involvement amidst all the distractions being hurled at us via the madman’s Tweets.

The lack of any legal precedence whatsoever is how this made it to SCOTUS. Chances are 0.01% of oral arguments — obviously very slim — but anything (reasonable) we can do to bring more attention to the hacking is indeed worth the time.
