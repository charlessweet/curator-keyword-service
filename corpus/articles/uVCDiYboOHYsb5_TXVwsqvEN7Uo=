Jefferson Beauregard Sessions may have been confirmed Wednesday as America’s newest Attorney General -- but it wasn’t without a fight. Wednesday morning I joined a group of nearly 20 concerned citizens to hand deliver a whopping stack of over 550 individual letters from Kentucky voters to Senator Rand Paul in opposition to Sessions’ nomination. Because of our powerful action, Sen. Paul can never deny that his constituents are watching and will hold him accountable for his actions.

My hometown, Bowling Green, Kentucky (of recent “Bowling Green massacre” fame) is home to the National Corvette Museum, a thriving public university, the world’s longest cave system -- and Senator Rand Paul. I’m proud to have grown up in a diverse community of immigrants and refugees. The International Center of Kentucky works tirelessly to resettle refugees here. Many of them are my former schoolmates, some of the most talented and compassionate people I’ll ever know. For our community, there is no question that Jeff Sessions’ record represents the antithesis of Kentucky values of hospitality and tolerance, which Sen. Paul presumably shares. So the decision to organize a demonstration around delivering over 550 letters from Kentuckians to Sen. Paul’s Bowling Green district office was an easy one for us.


The group gathered around a box filled with our nearly 600 letters before marching to the Senator’s office.
 
Many of our letters were collected through a Daily Kos campaign, and more were handwritten. They represented every corner of the state, from Pikeville to Paducah, and cities small and large, from Lexington to Glasgow. They ranged in length from a simple sentence (“Please reject Jeff Sessions”) to lengthy personal stories (“I love my country too much to see it go backward on these vital issues such as civil rights”). These Kentuckians showed incredible passion and we knew the action of delivering their letters to the Senator had to live up to this energy.

At 8:30 Wednesday morning, nearly two dozen citizens reflecting the proud diversity of this town gathered around my car in a chilly downtown parking lot around the corner from Senator Paul’s office, flanked by a handful of local news cameras and reporters. The energy was palpable as we marched down the block, letters in hand. The office staffer answered the door to a fierce, positive group of constituents who had come to engage their senator and make sure their fellow Kentuckians’ voices were heard as loudly as possible.

The result of the vote doesn’t invalidate our action or erase our passion.
Sessions was confirmed later that day in a 52-47 Senate vote, but the story doesn’t end there. The result of the vote doesn’t invalidate our action or erase our passion. Because close to 600 Kentuckians wrote to Senator Paul to express their views, because nearly two dozen citizens gathered on a chilly February morning, because we looked Sen. Paul’s liaison in the eye as one after the other we placed stacks of Kentuckians’ hopes and pleas into her hands (and then told the world about it online) -- because of this action, Sen. Paul knows we are watching. He, and all our elected officials, know that we will hold them accountable. We will challenge them if they vote against our interests. We will oppose them every time they side against us in Congress. We will write, call, and knock on their office doors as long as necessary. We will resist.

someone suggested an alt/town hall.  Invite him, but publicize and have the meeting in his absence.  You can run, but we are getting together to talk about issues even if you are too big a coward to show up.

My local group is going to have a life-sized cardboard photo of the RWNJ Rep as he refuses to hold any public meetings until August but is doing a paid private talk,"The New Trump Administration: A View From the Top."

I call every day and today I asked when he would be having a town hall.  His staff lady in the Bowling Green office is nice.  She said “probably not until summer.”

In Richmond Virginia today I attended a meeting--followup to Womens March. It was one of 14 such meetings in the metro area.

30 people RSVP'd-- about 200 showed up.

Organizer said to join our local Indivisible group. Next time we call a Republican, tell them we have x hundred others standing with us.

Very heartening!

Apparently, all letting Rand Paul know how awful Jeff Sessions is did is convince him even more strongly that Session is the right man for the job.

Good job!  This is taking off nationwide.  Accountability.  300 showed up at our GOP Reps office in our Deep Red Florida District.

When I think of Kentucky I think of your other Senator, the scarecrow.

Thank you!  I somehow missed your action, though I am on Kos all the time.  This Lexingtonian needs to write a letter to Rand Paul.  I have contacted our useless Congressman Barr over the Russian hacking.  No answer.  If Paul gives you an answer please post it.  I think of your lovely hometown every time I hear “Bowling Green Massacre”, LOL.  Maybe your city will get some tourism $$ out of it.  Of course, the sinkhole swallowing part of the Corvette Museum was a massacre to car lovers.

Not sure why you claimed the world’s longest cave system as belonging to Bowling Green. Mammoth Cave is in Hart County. I’d have to consult my De Lorme atlas, but is Hart County even adjacent to Warren County? Bowling Green is home to Lost River Cave, a very interesting 25 acre park with several karst windows where Lost River flows above ground, then below ground again. Lost River is fed by sinking streams from the Woodburn area. In years of heavy rainfall, two large transient lakes form near Woodburn These lakes gradually drain into Lost River and eventually drain into Barren River. When the lakes are up, they are the premier birding spots in the state, but get little press because the best of the two, McElroy Lake, is entirely on private, row-cropped farm land. If this property was purchased by Western KY University or some other entity that had public good in mind, it could give a level of fame to Bowling Green, at least among birders. But it isn’t part of the world’s longest cave system.

 The cave complex is located in Hart, Barren and Edmonson counties. Warren county is adjacent to Edmonson County. Just south on 31-W from Horse Cave to Bowling Green. This link will be helpful: www.kygetaway.com/...

the best way to resist is to vote, in every election, not just every 4 years. that’s how you get rid of these clowns. republicans tend to vote in every election, democrats not so much.

Many thanks to you!  I emailed him about Betsy DeVos, and, three weeks later, received a response that said he thought she would be great! YUCK!
