HOW THE GOP‚ÄôS SHORT POLITICAL MEMORY MAY MAKE THE PARTY IRRELEVANT

For nine long years, conservatives have been waging war on the ‚ÄúD.C. cartel,‚Äù as some call it, or fighting to ‚ÄúDrain the Swamp,‚Äù as others prefer. Conservatives have been organizing, making phone calls, storming social media, speaking up at town halls, and volunteering for campaigns with the hope that doing so would result in change.

Though conservatives haven't given up, Republicans have to a significant degree ignored these pleas for action, despite being handed power time and again to do something with it.
For many conservative voters, especially those not actively engaged in the grassroots, there may be a sense of complacency in these early stages of this new administration. Many may feel that though it is not happening rapidly, everything we have been fighting for will happen eventually. This sense of calm and trust can mitigate the impetus for action that got conservatives this far to begin with.

Contrast that with the progressive Left, which very much relies on a top-down nature of governance. Though they have not controlled Congress in recent years, their control of the Executive Branch left them in a state of relative comfort, knowing that they had the most powerful branch (in their view) and that President Obama could veto anything at odds with their cause. They knew that even though they would be largely unsuccessful in Congress, Obama wouldn't let them down when it counted.¬†Fast forward from that point to an unexpected Trump victory and an administration that leaves them with no real power at the federal level (aside from a liberal judiciary). You better believe this has lit a fire under their feet to reorganize and be heard.

The problem now is that some Republicans in Congress are seeing this rapid lashing out of the activist Left and taking it for more than it is. They are looking at their office call logs and the issue-ratios of support and opposition, and trying to suggest that two weeks‚Äô worth of data ‚Äî in a vacuum ‚Äî is enough to stifle their momentum. They seem to have forgotten those nine painstaking years of conservative blood and sweat.¬†

Don‚Äôt forget: Obama, Pelosi, D-Calif. (F, 10%) and Reid were successful because they were unafraid of tea party resistance and were willing to gamble their seats for the chance to effect true legislative change.

These members need to be reminded that, unfortunately, right-of-center voters are now in their own state of complacency, thinking that things are well in hand with the expectation that good reforms are just around the corner. If they aren‚Äôt blowing up the district phone lines, it‚Äôs because they feel they have already spoken and been heard. But this must not be confused for a change of heart or a lack of voice. Public sentiment on issues like immigration and Obamacare have not significantly shifted. The Left is merely taking its turn at the megaphone. Indeed, there will be great backlash from right‚Äìof-center voters if there is no action on critical campaign issues after years of promises.

The Republican Party is learning all the wrong lessons right now.

If members of Congress are freaking out about the call ratios against them on these issues, they need to be reminded of the reality of actual public sentiment. If the average right-of-center voter actually knew that Republicans were caving on repealing Obamacare, and breaking bad on a number of other issues down the road, they would be more furious and compelled to action than they currently are.

These members, desperate to take the temperature of the people, so afraid they might be off by a degree, seem to have forgotten that we just had an all-hands-on-deck referendum on these issues: it was called Election Day.

There will be consequences to the Republican Party using the conservative grassroots to gain power while continuously ignoring the promises made to those voters. One of these consequences may even be that¬†nine years later, when Republicans need their defense, the grassroots may not be there anymore.

The Republican Party is learning all the wrong lessons right now. And unless they keep their promises, they will lose the loyalty of their most active voters, and public sentiment and electoral outcomes will turn against them.

Will Republicans take the right path, the principled path, the path that leads to the reward of a better America and the continued support of grassroots warriors to keep them in power? Or will they cower in fear of progressives which will lead to an implosion of the Republican Party in future cycles?

If members want to complain about the call log ratios on these issues, we can always test this premise by having them go out and publicly state that he/she doesn't intend to repeal Obamacare and that he/she would actually prefer to keep most of it in place. Or that he/she will not push to lower debt and spending or significantly reduce the size and scope of government. Or even that he/she is fine with continued illegal immigration. Let them try it. Let them be that transparent if they think they are acting in accord with the mood of the electorate.

Then let's see the results of calls into their office.
