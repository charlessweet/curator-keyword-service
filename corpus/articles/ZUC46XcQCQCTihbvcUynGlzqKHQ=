Chris Matthews Criticizes Court Decision On Muslim Ban: “The Courts Have Gotten Into Somebody Else’s Marmalade”
Matthews: "I Like Presidents To Be Strong, Even This One. I Think We're Always Worse Off With A Weaker President"

From the February 9 edition of MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews:

CHRIS MATTHEWS (HOST): I'm joined right now by Margaret Carlson of the Daily Beast and Eli Stokols of Politico. I know -- and Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post. We don't have much time, but I want to hear from all of you.

My view is mixed now, because I think because I like presidents to be strong, even this one. I think we're always worse off with a weaker president.

I think the courts have gotten into somebody else's marmalade here, you start talking about policy and which countries to target and which ones not to target, these judges don't have any competence to do that. They may have a legal right to move that way, but we'll see.

[...]

MATTHEWS: Did you see this ruling, how wide it is? They basically said it has to do with due process, it has to do with, you know, everybody who's a person and they didn't even ask about people in some consulate, they said everybody involved in this is a person and therefore you can't do it.

[...]

MATTHEWS: I don't like weak presidents, and I don't think anybody gains from a weak president, but we'll see.
