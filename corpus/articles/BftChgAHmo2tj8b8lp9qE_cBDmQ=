During Tuesday night‚Äôs CNN debate on ‚ÄúThe Future of Obamacare‚Äù between Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas (A, 97%) and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. (F, 17%), the socialist from Vermont proved, repeatedly, that his ideas are out of touch with reality.

Here are five of the craziest things America‚Äôs cranky socialist uncle said (and why he's wrong):

1. ‚ÄúLet me get right to the point. Senator Cruz, like most Republicans, has said that he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or so-called Obamacare. Let me tell you what that will mean to the American people. It means that if you are one of 20 million Americans who finally has received health insurance, forget about it, you're gone ‚Ä¶ And that means when you get sick, you ain't going to be able to go to the doctor. And when you end up in the hospital, you'll be paying those bills for the rest of your life, or maybe you'll go bankrupt.‚Äù

In his opening remarks, Sanders warned that repealing the Affordable Care Act will kick people off their health insurance plans and remove their ability to go to the doctor. In reality Obamacare is already doing the very things Sanders is worried about.

The fact is the Affordable Care Act has driven up the cost of health insurance plans, canceled the insurance plans of millions of Americans, reduced choice by forcing insurers out of the market, and created a death-spiral scenario that is destroying the health insurance marketplace, preventing people from getting insurance to afford the health care they need.

2. ‚ÄúThis country has more rationing than any other industrialized country on Earth, except the rationing is done by income. And working-class people and poor people today are suffering as a result of that rationing.‚Äù

The socialist Sanders believes that the capitalist system ‚Äúrations‚Äù health care because people who can‚Äôt afford to purchase healthcare services (or insurance to afford those services) don‚Äôt buy insurance.

Firstly, that‚Äôs not rationing, that‚Äôs how a market works ‚Äì people without money can‚Äôt buy goods or services. Secondly, Sanders solution is to have the government dictate the kind of healthcare individuals receive (real rationing), not to drive down insurance costs through market reforms to make health insurance and healthcare more affordable for poor people.

3. ‚ÄúGovernment deciding? No, government doesn't decide in Canada or anyplace else.‚Äù

Sen. Sanders suggested that in countries with socialized medicine, the government does not make healthcare decisions for individuals. He is very wrong.

4. ‚ÄúI think that for businesses that employ 50 people or more, given the nature of our dysfunctional healthcare system right now, where most people do get their health insurance through the places that they work, I'm sorry, I think that in America today, everybody should have health care. And if you have more than 50 people, you know what, I think ‚Äì¬†I'm afraid to tell you ‚Äì¬†I think you will have to provide health insurance.‚Äù

Bernie Sanders straight up told a small business owner that she should be forced to provide health insurance to her employees even if she can‚Äôt afford it. Even Bill Clinton acknowledged small businesses are getting killed by Obamacare‚Äôs mandates. That‚Äôs not a problem for Sanders.

5. ‚ÄúThe United States is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a right. I believe we should move in that direction. The ACA has been a step forward. We have got to go further and join every other major country on Earth and say that if you are an American, you are guaranteed healthcare as a right, not a privilege.‚Äù

Two things.

First:


Second:


Healthcare is not a right to be guaranteed by the government. It is a service provided by doctors in a marketplace. The proper role for government in healthcare and health insurance markets is to ensure that barriers to trade are removed so entrepreneurial innovation lowers the price of healthcare over time and competition ensures health insurance is affordable for the people who need it most.

Obamacare, Bernie Sanders‚Äô first ‚Äústep forward‚Äù toward government provision of healthcare, has been such a disaster that Republican delay of repeal is indefensible.

It is time to try liberty.¬†
