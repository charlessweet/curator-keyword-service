MoveOn Statement on Trump’s So-Called ‘Pivot’ on Immigration
By Brian Stewart. Thursday, August 25 2016
Karine Jean-Pierre, national spokesperson and senior advisor for MoveOn.org Political Action, had the following statement in response to Donald Trump’s attempt to pivot away from his anti-immigrant policies:

“It’s not a pivot, it’s pandering. It is pandering to white voters in an attempt to wash away months’ worth of racist, bigoted, and sexist rhetoric and policies. Not only will it not work, it is insulting to all voters. Repeatedly over the last year, Donald Trump has shown his true colors and in doing so has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he is unqualified to lead our country. What we have seen over the last few days is just the latest example.”
