MoveOn to Senate Democrats: Shut Down Business, Block SCOTUS Nominee Until Trump’s Unconstitutional Agenda Is Stopped
By Brian Stewart. Tuesday, January 31 2017
Calls On Senate Dems To Shut Down Senate Business and Block SCOTUS Nominee Until Trump’s Shocking, Unconstitutional Agenda Is Blocked

Statement from Ilya Sheyman, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action:

“An independent judiciary is a cornerstone of American democracy and it is absolutely critical that the Supreme Court remains an independent check on Donald Trump’s power.  Our country cannot afford a Supreme Court justice with a lifetime appointment who will permanently cement the shocking and unconstitutional agenda that Donald Trump has already pursued in his one short week of governing.

“The coming fight over Trump’s nominee is fundamentally a choicepoint: Will Trump’s policies of destruction be pursued for one term, or will they be enshrined into our nation for a lifetime?

“Democrats must be clear: President Trump is not a run-of-the-mill threat. He threatens the fabric of our democracy, our security, and our people. And while too many Democrats in the Senate continue to use the old, more traditional playbook, Donald Trump and the GOP have ripped up the playbook and are playing by their own destructive rules.

“Now is not the time for business as usual or playing by the same rules of the past. Senate Democrats must use every procedural tool available to them to shut down the Senate and block Trump’s attempts to fill the Supreme Court seat that Republicans stole by filibustering for nearly a year.

“Until Trump begins to abide by the Constitution, and that starts by repealing the Muslim ban, we cannot even begin to discuss the merits of Trump’s nominee.

“The future of our constitutional democracy and republic are at stake.”
