Story highlights
Valedictorian tells classmates she is an undocumented immigrant
Larissa Martinez says she fled Mexico
She says she'll attend Yale University this fall
(CNN)This high school valedictorian made a bold proclamation in her graduation speech: "I am one of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the shadows of the United States."

Larissa Martinez, graduating from McKinney Boyd High School in McKinney, Texas, detailed her difficult journey to her class through a series of "unexpected realities," and ending on her undocumented status.
"I decided to stand before you today and reveal these unexpected realities, because this might be my only chance to convey the truth to all of you that undocumented immigrants are people, too," she said.

She told her classmates that immigrants, undocumented or not, are people with dreams, hopes, aspirations and loved ones, and want to help make America great again, but without a wall "built on hate and prejudice."

Martinez said she fled to Texas from Mexico with her mother and sister, and grew up caring for her sister while her mother worked from morning until night. School was her haven, she said, because knowledge was at her fingertips.
