LEVIN: EARTH TO LEFTIES, THE COURTS ARE OFTEN WRONG!
By: Phil Shiver | February 10, 2017

Font Size  A  A  A
‚ÄúCourts are often wrong,‚Äù said Mark Levin on his show Friday night. ‚ÄúCourts can be brilliant and can be wholly irresponsible.‚Äù

This shouldn‚Äôt come as a huge surprise to anyone given the course of American history, and specifically, cases such as Korematsu v. United States. Yet, the very liberals who so often undermine rule of law and trash the judicial system are now crying foul the minute anyone dare critique the Ninth Circuit Court‚Äôs recent ruling on Trump‚Äôs Immigration Order. Biased much?

Mark Levin took the time to remind everyone that Korematsu was forced by the Supreme Court to live in an internment camp during World War II ‚Ä¶ and he was a U.S. citizen. Now the Ninth Circuit Court, operating upon the same constitutional premise, has effectively decided that everyone¬†in the world is afforded due process rights in the United States of America. Talk about open borders.



How can a constitutional premise be decided in such incredibly different ways? Well, perhaps when the courts are politically motivated. Self-respecting liberals should admit that their anti-Trump politics are the overwhelming factor in the recent court decisions.

This kind of stolen sovereignty must end.
