Early in the week, Senator Steve Daines (MT) was presiding over the U.S. Senate when Senator Elizabeth Warren (MA) began reading Coretta Scott King’s letter detailing the racially-motivated voter suppression tactics of Jeff Sessions in Alabama. As you probably know by now, Sen. Mitch McConnell evoked an obscure rule to silence her and Sen. Daines agreed, telling Sen. Warren to “take a seat.”

Daine’s legislative colleagues and constituents back home in Montana were not happy. State Senator Mo Essen formally apologized to Sen. Warren and joined with constituents to read Coretta Scott King's letter inside Daine's Missoula office:

Daines staffers told the crowd, which was crammed into the small lobby, not to take photos or video due to sensitive information in the office. The crowd asked the staffers if they would step outside to listen to them. Staffers said they would prefer not to.
So everyone stayed inside, and the protesters took photos and video anyway.
"Our message to Senator Daines is we are extremely disappointed in his ability to listen to his constituents, to have any dialogue with his constituents," said Erin Erickson of Missoula Rises. "He's essentially shutting us out, and to see him on the national stage shutting down a fellow senator is something we cannot ignore."
Constituents have doggedly asked Sen. Daines for a town hall meeting while he’s back home in Montana this week and they’ve been met with silence. Since he hasn’t answered their calls, some constituents decided to put together a welcome party at the Bozeman airport and ask him directly for a town hall. He hurried through the airport, flashing a smile and refusing to talk to constituents, who finally started an impromptu “You work for us!” chant as he jumped into a waiting car and sped away.


The constituents who showed up at the airport said they did so out of frustration from his silence:

Protesters said the chant was unplanned, as they aimed for a peaceful confrontation to state their concern.

“I think it went as well as it could,” said Robbie Gammack, Bozeman resident. “Senator Daines refuses to speak with his constituents. We are asking for a town hall meeting, we have asked that through emails, through voicemails, through his website.”  

"It's important that we showed up, which we did, so that part went well,” said Betsy Swartz, Bozeman resident. “But we felt like we didn't really get anywhere in terms of having him stop and just say a few, a few sentences to us or promise us that town hall (meeting).”
You are looking good, Montana! Keep it up. In fact, double down.

Republicans like Daines remind me of Internet tough-guys. Big talkers when in their own space but complete wimps when in public.

Clearly they don’t need one to win elections at the state, local, and federal levels, just people selfish enough to take one afternoon out of their life, once in awhile, and go vote in an election.

They do pretty well at Basic Politics, winning elections across-the-board, in varying historical circumstances.

They don’t even know how to converse or answer questions from their constituents like a normal hymn being would.

Years and years of not doing this has caused them to lose that ability. They are very good however at talking to big money donors. This is how they actually spend their time and they have it down pat.

Talking to voters? Having a conversation the way normal human beings do?

Not part of  their skill set …..and even if it was they have too much to hide and prefer to remain hidden except for staged Soviet propaganda style events and speeches.

A big part of the conservative mentality is bullying for whatever one wants then watching to see who rolls over, and the Dems have been accommodating them for decades. Of course, conservative Republicans were always smug in their power since they had the corporate media running interference, but once confronted they are exposed for the wimps they are. Look at their frightened scrambling around now with a modicum of public backlash against their new controversial leader — they are not used to this “facing the public” stuff! I would like to think they have pushed beyond their limit of public tolerance and Dems have seen the handwriting on the wall.

Seeing these guys on the fleeing their constituents in place after place is encouraging.

But we must do some running of our own, putting up candidates for state legislative seats not only to change the partisan margins in those bodies, but to build a deep bench of progressives available to contest congressional seats, too, hard as some of them—like Daines—will be to beat.

What do you mean “want to see” if they’re holding a town hall?

Of course they are.

Citizens can stage a Rogue Town Hall on behalf of them.

Do press releases, get a venue and a date, pick appropriate issues, invite the rep of course and especially all the media Make your own video. If the rep shows, good on them, if they won’t, give ‘em hell and send the video to them and the media that weren’t present.

This strategy worked against Billionaire Bloomberg when he was New York’s mayor.  He refused to attend a town hall about an inane construction project he wanted to award to one of his fat-cat friends.  Our activists and representatives from both the state and local level conducted the meeting anyway, and it was taped and delivered to Mr. Bloomberg, who was shamed into submission, but at least he avoided facing the crowd and its respectful, yet forceful, group of commentators.  On the other hand, he ignored requests for many other town halls, enabling, among other things, the desecration of 2 Columbus Circle.

Rout: "a disorderly retreat or flight after a defeat." If that wasn't  a rout then I don't know how else to define it. The look on Beasty's face on the quick escape to her car while being yelled at wasn't the face of a victor. Maybe she will be accompanied by her brother Eric Prince's black op troops from now on. I don't think that's far fetched.

Inquiring minds want to know:

Haven’t we learned the lesson yet? Press releases don’t work. Asking the press nicely to report on this behavior doesn’t work. 

I must get a dozen emails a day with a “Donate” button on it. None of those emails tell me how the donation will be turned into action. 

If I’m going to donate to a cause, I want them to use the money to buy ads on a range of media (including Fox News and various right-wing talk shows) telling people that the Republicans are screwing them and what they need to do. I do like the large crowds who go to town halls and refuse to take No for an answer, but that mostly makes like-minded people happy. We have to get to the not-like-minded people.

I’m co-chair of the Democratic Ward committee in my Boston neighborhood. We have had more new people interested in our group since the election than at any time previously. We’re not going to keep that momentum if we don’t come up with something that is actually productive.

Ads on prime time cable and TV are expensive. Billboards are less so, but can readily be countered if not very carefully phrased.

IMO, very few of those folks are reachable. You’re proposing to spend a ton of money trying to appeal to Jade Helm, Pizza Gate, Bowling Green Massacre, Obama is a Muslim, Obama was born in Kenya, Twitler had 20 million at his inauguration believing audience.

If I could recommend this 1,000 times, I would. This is exactly what I’ve been talking to my spouse about—while there is a percentage of Trump supporters who are never going to change their minds, there are people like my MIL who might sometimes watch Fox News but who also is disgusted by corporate control of government and those minds could potentially be changed. Some well-placed ads highlighting things like Mnuchin’s foreclosures or Betsy DeVos’s sickening GOP payoffs could go a long way to highlight information they’re not getting...but would Fox or similar outlets run them? I doubt it, but there might be other outlets that reach more of a cross-section of people and not just progressives/Democrats like us.

We need to get out of our echo chamber and reach the millions of people who haven’t been as engaged, aren’t checking Trump's antics or watching more reputable media on a daily basis, and aren’t as aware of all the insanity that is going on but would be disturbed and more likely to vote against Trump and the Republican sycophants in Congress if they knew more.  

The timing on this is another question. I wouldn’t wait until 2018 to start running ads. I might not start today, but I would start this year and keep updating/building the messaging (lord knows Trump and his Swamp Cabinet will give us plenty of material). Can the DNC work on something like this? Can any of those Dem senators (like Schumer) that have money left over in their war chests donate it to an effort like this (if that’s allowed)?

This is what the modern Republican Party does, as they long for the day that all Senators will just be appointed by the president with no hassle over silly “Representative Democracy.”  Like the corrupt governments in Russia, Turkey and the Philippines, they would prefer total power and no responsibility.

Seems an ideal opportunity for Jon Tester to hold Town Halls in Montana and explain the differences between the Democratic and Republican agendas. Media coverage will be more than willing to contrast “show” and “no-show.”

Democratic Senators need to exploit this window of opportunity and hold Town Halls in Republican held districts across the country while the media is paying attention.

HE WILL SIT UP AND BEG LIKE A COCKER SPANIEL AT THE SIDE OF THE TABLE. AS SOON AS HE SEES HIS OFFICE AT RISK, HE WILL GO INTO SELF SURVIVAL MODE, AND THEN HE’LL REALLY GET FAKE.

Make an active and public effort to primary him.  Find a good candidate and keep talking.  Both the press and he will pay attention.  I don’t care where he is in the election cycle

Bullshit. Classic bullshit.

Why? If you had spent ten to fifteen minutes searching on something such as “recall of federal elected officials” you would get civics 001 on that subject. Among the top three is a legal analysis with cites that is itself cited in the second hit of that combination of words in Google.

The cited legal analysis is the 2012 “Recall of Legislators and the Removal ofMembers of Congress from Office” that covers that ground very well. A paragraph from the introduction:

As to removal by recall, the United States Constitution does not provide for nor authorize the recall of United States officers such as Senators, Representatives, or the President or Vice President, and thus no Member of Congress has ever been recalled in the history of the United States. The recall of Members was considered during the time of the drafting of the federal Constitution in 1787, but no such provisions were included in the final version sent to the states for ratification, and the specific drafting and ratifying debates indicate an express understanding of the framers and ratifiers that no right or power to recall a Senator or Representative in Congress exists under the Constitution. Although the Supreme Court has not needed to directly address the subject of recall of Members of Congress, other Supreme Court decisions, as well as the weight of other judicial and administrative decisions, rulings, and opinions, indicate that (1) the right to remove a Member of Congress before the expiration of his or her constitutionally established term of office is one which resides exclusively in each house of Congress as expressly delegated in the expulsion clause of the United States Constitution, and (2) the length and number of the terms of office for federal officials, established and agreed upon by the states in the Constitution creating that federal government, may not be unilaterally changed by an individual state, such as through the enactment of a recall provision or a term limitation for a United States Senator or Representative. Under Supreme Court constitutional interpretation, since individual states never had the original sovereign authority to unilaterally change the terms and conditions of service of federal officials agreed to and established in the Constitution, such a power could not be “reserved” under the Tenth Amendment. Even the dissenters in the Supreme Court decision on the Tenth Amendment and term limits, who would have found a “reserved” authority in the states regarding “qualifications” of Members of Congress, conceded that the exclusive authority to remove a sitting Member is delegated to each house in the expulsion clause of the Constitution, and that with respect to “a power of recall ... the Framers denied to the States [such power] when they specified the terms of Members of Congress.”
That paragraph from the introduction sets the stage for the body with far more detail.

I’m glad to see them standing up and saying enough. Elected officials need to be reminded early and often they work for We The People, not just the ones stroking them a big campaign contribution check.

I am from Montana, I couldn’t even find a phone number to leave a voicemail.  I sent some emails and a snail mail letter but he unlike Tester doesn’t even reply with a “thank you for your concern” email.

i don’t want this look like I am defending him, but he just happened to be the one presiding, and he had to say whatever the parliamentarian told him to say.

Yes.  I guess he did have to follow the rules.  But there must be something he could have done to express his position on the matter, even if it was a statement after the fact.  If he was too intimidated by McConnell then he is a wimp and doesn’t deserve to serve the good people of Montana.  He didn’t say anything (as far as I know) and I am willing to guess that he didn’t give a shit that Warren and Mrs. King were disrespected.

If he has any huevos he could have told his constituency where he stood.  He could have faced them, listened to them, and responded.  That is his job.  No huevos there.

(I have decided to use the term ‘huevos’ since it applies to both men and women, just in different areas of the anatomy.)

They jump when McConnell speaks.   Interpretation of the rules is what I would have called for had I been presiding.  Even though he read the rule,  you know what is ….is.

House and Senate, from both parties, every time they come home. We have gotten way too complacent. I am very encouraged by the rising tide of active citizens I’m seeing lately.

No representative should ever feel they can ignore their constituents without paying for it at election time. If they have town hall meetings then attend them, and ask questions. If they don’t then raise a stink about it.

It’s past time these so called representatives start feeling a little more fear for their jobs.

Protest in front of their homes and don’t stop! If anti abortion protesters can gather outside of clinics, we can protest outside of the homes of these Senators and House members. Let  their families see what people think of them! It is time to change!

`Senator who told Elizabeth Warren to 'take a seat' got a not-so-warm welcome back to Montana
