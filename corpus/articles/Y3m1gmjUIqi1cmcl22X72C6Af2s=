We already knew Donald Trump’s blathering about Hillary Clinton’s email server was hot air. Not only is he using an unsecured and obsolete smartphone, but his national security adviser has a long history of blowing off rudimentary security procedures.

But on Friday, Trump revealed beyond all doubt that he is extremely reckless—at best—when dealing with classified information. That afternoon. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich coming to the White House to tout an expanded factory near Phoenix. When Senator Martin Heinrich read about it later in the day, couldn’t help but notice that there was a key to a lockbag of classified documents sitting on Trump’s desk—in plain view of Krzanich and the gathered reporters. So Heinrich busted the president on it.


There is no evidence that anyone got their hands on that key. But as I note at Liberal America, that’s beside the point. There is no good-faith reason to leave a key to classified information out in the open. Trump should not have needed to be told that he needed to hide that bag and that key before Krzanich and the reporters arrived.

So far, there has been no response from the White House. Equally tellingly, there has been no response from Repubs in either chamber. So when we hear mere innuendo about Hillary’s emails, we heard chants of “Lock her up! Lock her up!” Clear evidence of Trump being reckless with classified information? Silence.

This is not acceptable. Unless Trump has a good explanation for this—and I don’t think there is one—this proves beyond any doubt that he is not fit to be president. In a sane world, when a president is this staggeringly reckless, we would at least be starting discussions about a 25th Amendment solution. After all, when a president shows this kind of reckless disregard for security procedures, we should at least be asking if that president is of sound mind.

Classified document on a cluttered desk is bad practice. Not as much of a problem as classified documents on a cluttered desk with a reporter taking pictures of the desk. 

Of course, instead of a courier bag, it could have simply been a bank bag filled with rent collected by Uday and Qusay.

But as to the White House’s explanation, there will be none. If any of them is ever asked in an interview, they will most likely deny it, say it was photoshopped in by the “fake news media”.

Also we knew months before the election that he very definitely was not of sound mind but millions voted for him anyway; possibly most of them are not of sound mind either.

It’s part of a larger pattern of sloppy OpSec.  Trump’s team also use the same RNC email server that was hacked by Russia at the same time they hacked the DNC server.   

Then there’s Trump’s smartphone.  Lawfare takes an exhaustive look at his insecure Android twitter machine here.  Not only could an adversary take over his twitter account, they could compromise it with malware to collect sound and video wherever the president takes the phone.  The security risk is insane.  

If Obama had committed any of these security lapses the GOP would have howled for impeachment.

Substitute any of the things Trump has done in his first 3 weeks, and they would have done the same.  Somehow this doesn’t get through to Republicans.  If there’s any progress to be made on impeachment, this point has to be understood and acted upon by Republicans.

Someone uncleared grabbing the key would have gotten them in trouble and I don't think you can use "I was making a point about what a dumbass the current commander in chief is" as a defense. If someone who had a clearance snatched it maybe they could have made the point without getting in trouble but even then access to classified is on a need-to-know basis, so that person might have gotten into trouble too.

I assume they’re even more outraged by these transgressions. They must be even angrier about such obvious lapses in both security and transparency, to the point that they will be unable to contain their fury. The outraged rants should be epic…..

There is also no evidence that the bag actually had anything in it. This is a non issue. I have used such bags and when they are on my desk I can have the key anywhere that I want. The bags are for transport outside a secure area. When inside a secure area, which the Oval Office is, it is just a bag.

You missed the point that the office had non-cleared visitors. The area was no longer secure. It’s not like they would have browsed through the material or carted it off, but it was a bit more than sloppy procedure- it was a violation of the regs or maybe even law.

We are witnessing something unique in all of American history. Not only do we have a president who only responds positively to his base and negatively to the rest of the world, a man who lies incessantly, but more dangerous to everyone on earth, he is a very careless man whose behavior is based on urges and impulses. The fact he has shown a propensity to be careless when he is in any situation that demands a well thought out strategy before reacting, has to be horrifying regardless of political ideology.

Here is the worst scenario. A terrorist organization tied to Iran conducts some kind of action that the press or our intelligence first reports massive loss of life. Maybe in the hundreds. Same kind of blurry unsubstantiated intelligence we had with Iraq and 911. Let’s say as part of that report there is evidence Iran has engaged in restarting their nuke program and the claim says Iran is 1 month from completing their program and will deploy it on a long range missile capable of reaching American soil. This is not a test, this is a real-life scenario that can make unproven claims based on political bias and tragedy turn into a world-wide crisis by 1 man whose finger is on the nuclear trigger. Do you want that man to have a first response of action based on prejudice or someone who asks the hard questions before they react? We have someone who has proven time and again his first impulse is always the answer and always reaches for the most negative response imaginable. Political pundits, average people and even elected officials can afford to be careless and even get away with it. Not the man with his finger on the trigger of life on the planet.

One can add to this the failed Yemeni raid which saw destruction of civilian life, including children as well as the death of US military personnel and destruction of US military equipment and not a peep...what will it take? His ignorance and incompetence are staggering and beyond belief. Not surprising to anyone here or anyone who didn’t vote for him. And those who did simply don’t care.
