80,000? I just came from there and I would have guessed about 5,000 to 10,000 tops. Womens march was 17,000-20,000 and I would say this was maybe 1/3 of that. I had to leave around 11:30 but I went up to the top floor of a parking garage to see how big it was and it was nothing like the womens march! That was packed. But still a good morning and lots of people there!

Hi Sis.  Thanks for this liveblog — I’ve been following.  Re: the count — have to laugh.  I remember in NYC I thought, wow — we’re packed but it was just in Dag Hammerskjold Park (2nd Ave down 47th to 1st Ave (I thought). 

I was there at 9:30.  When we finally started marching after 1 p.m. none of us had a clue that 2nd Ave was mobbed up to at least 59th and then south towards 42nd.  People were emerging from every possible artery.

So, sort of funny to guess a head count so early.

All I know is that folks who were there in 2014 said this crowd was bigger.  I was there in 2014 and it was huge.

No matter — the important thing is that they got folks to turn out and will continue to organize.

The good Reverend was on passionate fire today. He reminded us of the long history of the fight for justice beginning with the first reconstruction after the Civil war. We are part of a long march for righteousness. His message rang true like the liberty bell. People left feeling inspired.

It's very hard to tell how many people participated. We arrived late while some folks with kids were leaving early. The marchers kept on marching so people were strung out around Raleigh.


It was hard to see through all the signs.

Yay! I have to work today, but my parents and my church group will be there. I texted my mom that she should wear her doctor’s white coat, and she was worried it would look silly. She dislikes pretentiousness, but I think it makes a statement about support for the ACA. And I’ve certainly seem attendees in white coats.

Howdy from Raleigh! Mike and I cut out a bit early after marching. There were SO many people, particularly young, college-age folks. This was the youngest crowd overall I've seen for this thing. The Raging Grannies were a big hit and Reverend Barber was spiting fire!

Last year, the NAACP had a huge All Lives Matter sign. This year, Black Lives Matter signs and banners and flags were everywhere. Which was pretty amazing in a majority-white crowd.

The only weird note was how Reverend Barber was introduced. It was like he was the second coming of MLK. He doesn't usually have such an ostentatious intro.

So glad we went. And SO glad it was much warmer than last year.

I was so glad to have had the chance to hear him speak in person at NN. I had of course seen recorded speeches by MLK and others, and they were extremely powerful. But there is an additional dimension when you can be there in person, and Rev. Dr. Barber’s speech was absolutely electrifying in a way I could not have imagined. Galvanizing is another word that comes to mind. He is a remarkable man, and we are lucky to have such an activist willing and able to lead.

The crowd was much larger than last year and the weather was much nicer this year. I even got the wife to attend her first protest march! We left a bit early as the crowd was so large we couldn’t get close enough to the stage to hear anything. My pics are not in order but I will caption them.


This is where we  were at the end of the march, from here we could not hear the speakers or even see the video screen, let alone the grandstand where the speakers were.
 

Unfortunately she does have to protest this crap again. 

He has grooming advise for 45.

From local TV website report:

The Republican Party released a statement about the march.

“The agenda supported by this march is a march towards bigger and more expansive government, higher taxes and fewer jobs in North Carolina. It is an agenda soundly defeated in four consecutive statewide elections, and does not represent the agenda of most North Carolinians,”  said Dallas Woodhouse, the executive director of the N.C. GOP.

To which I would tweet, if I were on twitter, only more wittily and tersely, “We just elected a Democratic Governor, repudiating YOUR agenda, you asshole, the only statewide vote your GOOPY party couldn’t rig through gerrymandering.”

@DallasWoodhouse by the way.

There were more Dem than Republican votes in the last 2 elections. We are very effectively gerrymandered from the perspective of a racist Republican.

I saw someone with a dailykos t-shirt but I couldn't get close enough to say hi. I went with my wife and met some friends at the march.

That’s great! The GOP whack-o’s tried to make the moral march illegal if I recall, but let them try and arrest all those Red Hats and the fecal material will hit the fan blades and cover the GOP in you know what.

Sunday RW talking points on the march:  Wow, paying for a crowd of paid NC protesters that size must have set George Soros back a bit. Need to have a NC legislative investigation of where these bussed in outsiders were from. And how disappointing that  a minister of God like the Rev. Barber would be mixing politics and religion.
