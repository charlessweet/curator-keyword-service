These guys have yet to get a clue! Rep. Jason Chaffetz came home to Utah and faced a full capacity crowd for his town hall, bolting almost an hour early to chants of "Your last term!" Rather than reconcile the obvious anger from his constituents and rethink his support of Donald Trump and Paul Ryan’s destructive agenda, he’s blaming “paid protesters.” From the Deseret News:

Chaffetz said the crowd that filled the auditorium at Brighton High School in Cottonwood Heights and spilled over into a protest outside included people brought in from other states to disrupt the meeting.

"Absolutely. I know there were," he said, suggesting it was "more of a paid attempt to bully and intimidate" than a reflection of the feelings of his 3rd District constituents.

Asked who would foot the bill to fill the audience with outside agitators, Chaffetz said, "do some reporting" and described how one participant made it a point to say he was not being paid by a national Democratic organization.
Are you getting paid, Utah residents? Who do these fools think are paying people to show up and oppose them? Can Chaffetz point to some super, top-secret job listing board? Rep. Chaffetz, it is time to put this “paid protester” fantasy to rest and face the facts that your own constituents are not happy and 100 percent want you to do your job as their representative and as the chairman of the House Oversight Committee. There are 633 days until the 2018 midterm elections and if you don’t do your job now, you could find yourself looking for a new job then. 

If you are a Utah resident and you want to let Jason Chaffetz know that you are NOT a paid protester, here are the ways you can contact him to let him know you are not a #PaidProtester:

This tactic surely will be seen as an insult to everyone in his district who showed up.  This is his way of saying, “I don’t give a flying fuck what the constituents say, I’m serving my special interest masters”  We really need to get a backlash midterm wave election happening.

I feel it coming on. Though, gotta admit, I’ve thought that over the last several elections. But, we’ve never had the energy going that I see now.

The “paid protestor” thing is getting really fking old. Not just b/c it’s outrageously wrong, but also b/c Chaffetz and company could say anything and know that they could say the world is flat so it’s easy for protestors to tip the world down a little and the protestors slide over — and their voters would believe it with a firm nod of the head.

We’re supposed to not think their voters are stupid. Well fk that. They believe the paid protestor thing and illegal voter thing, unbelievable.

But you have to realize this is ‘Projection’ because this is exactly what the Brothers Kock, and their TEA baggers did, hire people to make noise and cause problems, so the Republican thought process is “Well we did, so are they”. Everytime a Republican makes an accusation against the Democrats, you know they pulled the same stunt.

It’s not that they are always wrong, as some tactics are good, but it’s a guarantee if the Republicans are protesting some “immoral action”, they were doing it, which is why ‘they know’ someone was doing it, it was them. By fling and flailing they are hoping to catch someone else and detract from their hot mess.

You beat me to it!  It is definitely Projection. There are any number of FRL (Far Right Loon) sugar daddies that can pay their “protesters”:  the Kochs, the Mercers, Sheldon Adelson, and innumerable others.

All they can up with on our side is “George Soros”. I have participated in a lot of protests, including in Washington DC in May 2001 to oppose the illegal installation of George W. Bush as President by the Supreme Court. Needless to say, I have never received so much as a dime from anyone to pay my expenses.

Reminded me of all the things Drumpf was calling Hillary out for, “Crooked Hillary”, “Untrustworthy Hillary”, her deleted e-mails, her private server and on and on and so forth.

When you know what Drumpf is, everything he said about Hillary, is what he is and to the nth degree! It is unbelievable how crooked Drumpf really is and the fact everything out of his mouth was a lie.

Now, instead of “draining the swamp” he is “adding huge Wallstreet billionaire alligators, to swallow up all the benefits, which the people have finally gotten.

Then the private e-mail server thing, which they bitched about Hillary using, when she was in the State Dapartment. Now Drumpf, as President, has his own private e-mail server, which does not have the option to save the e-mails he deleted from it.

Then also, in his thousands of lawsuits, he made sure to not only delete e-mails, but actual records, which the IRS had subpoenaed, from the companies he owned.

What I have been pointing out, including in a tweet a few minutes ago in the responses to a Chaffetz tweet, is that if people are in fact being paid, like the hired extras for the Hairball’s candidacy announcement — also known as the Golden Escalator Ride — it’s easy to prove payment.

If George Soros were actually paying the millions of people who have been protesting since 1/21, they would have been flooding the airwaves and social media with proof of that by now.

They don’t have a single piece of evidence, because every frackin bit of our protesting is born of rage, fury, passion, and a thirst for justice. Not greed.

They need to pull their heads out of the sand and learn at that real people are REALLY angry. My congresswomen did not even revert to this when Tea Party types showed up at a townhall meeting she had to scream about “death panels” and ‘killing granny.” She just assumed they truly (wrongly) believed this.

I’ve noticed the framing of stories, lately. For example, if Hillary would have had Russians hack the election for her and had multiple Russians connections and had her top National Security Advisor illegally coordinating with the Russians and was groveling before Putin like Trump…..then EVERYDAY 24/7 there would be SCREAMING HEADLINES “REPUBLICANS ACCUSE CLINTON  OF ________ (fill in the blank).

It’s getting a little better lately, but for a while there the headline was always “TRUMP SAYS ACCUSATIONS ARE NONSENSE” or something to that effect rather than “DEMS ACCUSE TRUMP OF..”

Framing is everything. It controls the population and the direction of the nation.

I attended Brighton High briefly.  It’s not in a dense, downtown area.  You’d notice a fleet of buses VERY easily.  It’s in a fairly affluent suburb next to a nice apartment complex and the only nearby parking is the school lot.  There’s literally nothing across the street (because of a steep decline, it’s just a major road running in front of the school) and residences for a LONG way in either direction.

He knows he’s lying, and he doesn’t even care that it’s so obvious.  He must think we’re stupid, which I admit given the sorry state of the Utah education system isn’t a bad bet, but nobody’s THAT stupid.

Let’s hope so. There is a lot to do between this protest now and the election 21 months away. Getting enough people to vote against Chaffetz when the time comes will require a lot of hard work going forward. The first step being to find a viable candidate. Chaffetz has won with 66% or more of the vote every time he has run since 2008. His Democratic opponent in 2016 got 27% of the vote. That is a chasm to bridge.

In Utah, it’s a bit more complicated. The Rep party has had a highly successful branding as the party of “family values” since Reagan, while the Dems were branded as the party of corruption. That brand (family values) plays very well to a certain segment of Utah’s population. The GOP has also had the full support and backing of the LDS church. Getting that stranglehold released is what has to happen. It doesn’t matter how good the person running actually is; being not GOP (or Libertarian or Constitution or Teabag) is a huge black mark, especially in Chaffetz’ district which is largely composed of Provo and its surrounding suburbs. Our other three districts are ridiculous gerrymanders, but that one was designed specifically to encompass BYU and those who wish to remain near it. It’s the Church’s district. The other three are designed to dilute the influence of liberal and comparatively less LDS Salt Lake City.

There was a tweet from Occupy Oakland that night that basically said ‘we knew what we had to do and we did it.  and we won.’ 

So this is a thing — willingness to be violent in opposition to fascism.   On one hand I can sympathize because it is best not to allow fascism to gain a foothold at all.  But violence begets violence, and it is destructive.

Even if we reject the comprehensive evidence that much of the Tea Party was an astroturfed Dick Armey affair, why should we suppose that left-leaners are the only people who’d be motivated to protest by a few pieces of silver? I’m sure “Jason in the House” has constituents who’d take a few bucks to wear their loudest, most offensive Trump garb and scream into megaphones about “takers” and “losers.” And really, if support for his ideas are so popular, it’s hard to understand why none of the people who think that public land should be up for auction and that it’s totally groovy that Kellyanne wants to advertise the latest faux fur Ivanka leggings don’t show up.

Note to all Democrats: the charge Republicans are making about “paid protestors” demonstrating at their community ‘town halls’ and other constituent meetings in their districts is just their latest, made-up (no proof whatsoever!) way to marginalize opposition to their votes and political attitudes.

Coming to you from the very dark heart of Republican polling consultants, or someone in that sphere.

Demand proof : real proof, not just an occasional out-of-the blue alleged protestor who makes some questionable ‘confession.’  That would likely be someone paid by Republican operatives* to claim that they were paid; if so, ask for the paper trail.

Asked who would foot the bill to fill the audience with outside agitators, Chaffetz said, "do some reporting" and described how one participant made it a point to say he was not being paid by a national Democratic organization.
Gotta just love the bizarro level logic at work, here.

Yes, ONE participant making “a point to say he was not being paid” somehow leads to the audience being filled “with outside agitators.”  Most rational people would think that one participant was using that “point” to show Chaffetz the claims of “outside agitators” was just GOP bullshit.

Then again, rational people don’t run for political office as a Republicon.  Only psychopaths, sociopaths and greedy assholes do so.

It’s well to keep in mind that like most outrageous lies told by the Republicans, Rep. Jason Chaffetz does not himself believe what he’s saying.  He’s just accepted the Fox news model where all one has to do is delude enough of the simple minded in order to confuse the issue long enough for some other issue to become a distraction.   That is, there’s no point in “convincing Rep. Chaffetz” as he’s already convinced.  Your goal should be preventing him from convincing Bubba Johnson that some elaborate conspiracy is underway rather than what is far more likely.

They say “paid protestors” because they know their followers will believe the lie, right wing media is putting the lie out there constantly, and because they know George Soros is behind it all with his money.

what an idiot.  I saw the “town hall” meeting happening in real time.  What an idiot… Chaffetz can waste as much time as he pleases making up stories (hello “alternative facts” seems to be the republican MO these days.. Hello trump, spicer, conway, etc.) hopefully, his district will see him for what he is… a kiss ass pansy to trump and his merry band of deplorables (sorry… Hillary truly scored when she used this word.  she should have used it for trump and his people, but regardless….)  hoping the people in his district change their minds and vote someone in that is not afraid of Trump… Just the fact that instead of listening to what the people were saying (and they were pissed off) he says  they were “paid protesters”… first of all, I think we have all seen nobody needs to pay the people to protest.  they are quite happy to protest on their own.  Second, again, instead of giving “alternative facts” this ass should start doing what’s best for the people and stop giving out alternative facts

Shortly after Donald Trump announced that he was running for president, the Hollywood Reporter wrote that a New York–based casting agency called Extra Mile had apparently hired actors to fill out his announcement event (which took place on June 16, 2015, at Trump Tower in New York). Trump's team immediately denied that anyone at the announcement was a paid actor. A document released Thursday by the Federal Election Commission, however, concludes otherwise.
The FEC document is, specifically, a record of its decision not to sanction the Trump campaign for conduct related to the apparent transaction. A complaint filed by an activist group that supported Hillary Clinton had alleged that the Trump camp had violated reporting laws related to payments for the actors; the FEC concluded that no significant violation had occurred because the campaign later disclosed a payment to a contractor (Gotham Government Relations) that subcontracted with Extra Mile. But in the course of explaining why it would not discipline the campaign, the FEC concludes that some announcement attendees were, in fact, paid to be there:
In this matter, the available information indicates that the [Trump campaign] retained Gotham as an event consultant, and Gotham, in turn, subcontracted with Extra Mile to provide extra administrative support at Trump's announcement, including the provision of at least some of the rally crowd.

It is truly amazing that the Rethug’s think ALL OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS, are adoring fans, whom trust them to have the constituent’s best interests in mind.  Never occurred to them there are hundreds of thousands, even millions of their constituents, whom are able to think for themselves and knew exactly what is up with their Congressional Representatives, in there district, despite the “smoke & mirrors” & “slight of hand”, which is shown to them.

Not all of them are “unable to think for themselves”, and rely on their Rethug Representative to tell them the truth and keep them informed of what is really going on, even though the Representative is using a lot of words, to sugar coat his evil intentions! 

Their constant lies about how bad Obamacare is, not reminding their own constituents, the original name is the ACA, Affordable Care Act. Obamacare is the term they slapped on the ACA, because they were sure it was going to fail.

SURPRISE! It’s a huge success! Now people are realizing all the hooey, which was spoon fed to them by the Rethugs are all lies. Repealing Obamacare is actually repealing the ACA, which millions of them are on and forever thankful for.

Take note Rethugs, your constituents are on the war path! They are not going to let the Representatives, whom they voted into office, take hard earned Health benefits away from them, as can be seen by the thousands of protests in multiple cities.

Now that the Rethugs are seeing the massive protests, in the streets, of the city, where their offices are, they don’t know what to think. Now they claim someone is paying professional protesters!   Really! Do they think the Democrats have donors with the bottomless pockets like their own Rethug Sugar Daddies, such as the Koch Brothers? 

The Rethugs, in their own constituent’s district, have their own constituents rising up and willing to fight and protest those representatives, whom are more than willing to vote, to take Medical Insurance away from them, which they never had before. They did not vote you in, to take things away from them!

For further evidence, see also Brooks Brothers’ Riot (Gore/Bush Miami vote recount) and Jane Meyer’s Dark Money and its reports on the use of right-wing funding of “astroturf” groups created specifically to make it look like public organizations supported right wing issues when in fact the groups existed only because of the funding and organization provided to them by those sources specifically for those reasons.  

See also Tea Party faux rage generated by right wing PR activist Sal Russo in CA.

There's no question that Tea Party Express, the political action committee Russo runs out of his Sacramento-based firm, is the advertising muscle behind the tea party insurgency. In Delaware, the group spent $236,000 on television and radio commercials on behalf of Christine O'Donnell before last week's Republican primary, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, helping her beat the expected winner, Rep. Michael N. Castle.

Earlier this year, the PAC dropped nearly $600,000 in Alaska on ads that boosted Joe Miller over Sen. Lisa Murkowski, and racked up $944,000 in advertising in Nevada backing Sharron Angle, who hopes to unseat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

(snip)

Fueling suspicion is the fact that the PAC paid $516,000 to one of Russo's two firms between January 2009 and early August of this year, according to campaign finance reports. Some of the money went to cover travel and vendor costs, but a large share was for consulting and advertising commission fees. Another $340,000 was paid to 13 people, including Russo, for consulting and staff wages.

I hope we all know now, that the threat is real & from within. I sure hope Americans will empower themselves! I have hope that it is indeed happening.

Reportedly, this was exactly what the Tea Party was doing, with Koch brothers money.  So they may sincerely believe that people don’t do this unless they are paid.  The idea that people may be motivated by conscience and principle is probably alien to them.

If you go to Youtube and search “Soros paid protesters,” you will find an alternate reality bubble of people who truly and sincerely believe that most anti-Trump protesters are paid, by George Soros, who also financed the riots in Ferguson and elsewhere, because he is trying to create chaos in the United States.  After all (seemed to the be point of view of one such video I watched) everyone loves Trump, so who could possibly have a genuine motive to protest against him?  The proof offered was an announcement by an activist group that they were hiring people, at $15 an hour, to work on opposing Trump’s agenda.  According to the video, this means being hired to demonstrate. 

And the proof that this is financed by Soros is self-evident. At $15 per hour, a two-hour demonstration with one million people would cost $30 million, but with the cost of transporting all these people, a large demonstration could easily run $100 million, and who could afford that but a billionaire? And what billionaire would want to do such a thing except Soros, who finances riots and social unrest everywhere?  So, obviously the demonstrations are Soros' work.

It’s important for us to enter those reality bubbles a little bit and get to know something about their internal logic.  There is no possibility of communication unless we understand something of the other point of view.

Here’s the deal.  The Utah state legislature —  pure Republican — has taken great pains to redistrict democrats out of having representation.  A couple years back — after the 2010 Census — I found myself — NOT in the 2nd Congressional District — but in the 3rd….and guess who was on the ballot?  Jason Chaffetz.

This is what you get, Jason — for gerrymandering your district — combining progressive Salt Lake County Democrats with your churchy Provo Republicans.

We are Utahns who have lived here since 1990.  I was born in Madison, WI and my spouse was born in Southern California.  It’s very hard to find people here who are not from somewhere else — particularly in Salt Lake County.  The whole world is moving here.

`Rep. Chaffetz says some of the overflow crowd in Utah were 'paid protesters' from out of state
