The Hill reports that New York Democrat Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand denies rumors that she will run for president in 2020.

Gillibrand told radio host John Catsimatidis, during an interview on AM 970 in New York, that she is running for reelection to the Senate, 2018:

No, I am running for Senate. I’m running for Senate in 2018. I really love my job and I feel like I can make a huge difference for New Yorkers, fighting for them.
Sen. Gillibrand has served in the Senate since 2009  and has been hyped as a potential presidential contender both before and after the 2016 election.

She has been a harsh critic of many of President Trump’s Cabinet nominees, is the only senator to vote against confirmation of eight Trump nominees and the “lone senator who voted against retired Gen. James Mattis for secretary of Defense.”

The Gillibrand denial is reminiscent of then Sen. Barack Obama denying he would run for president before he did.
