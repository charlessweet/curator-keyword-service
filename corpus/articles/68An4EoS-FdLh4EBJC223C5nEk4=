Water from Lake Oroville flowed over the emergency spillway at Oroville Dam for the first time in the reservoir's 48-year history after the water level reached 901 feet in elevation this morning.

The flow over the auxiliary spillway has been between 6,000 and 12,000 cubic feet per second (cfs), according to an update from the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) at 10:14 am. on February 11. "There is "no danger to dam or people" from the flows, according to DWR.

In a news  briefing today, DWR Director Mark Croyle said dealing with the damage caused by the growing hole in the dam's primary spillway could cost $100 to $200 million. 

He said the damaged spillway will need "complete replacement," noting that the current structure is "toast all the way to the bottom."

In a statement earlier today, DWR said the volume of water "is expected to pose no flood threat downstream and should remain well within the capacity of the Feather River and other channels to handle. Oroville Dam itself remains safe, and there is no imminent threat to the public."

"The emergency spillway has not been used since the dam was finished in 1968, but DWR has anticipated and prepared for its use since Tuesday, when erosion opened a cavity on the concrete, gated spillway typically used in winter operations at Lake Oroville," the agency said. "DWR continues to use that damaged spillway to discharge 55,000 cubic feet per second, but the approximately 95,000 cfs inflow to the lake exceeds that discharge. As of 4 a.m., the lake level was .7 feet away from the 901 foot elevation at which water flows over a concrete weir and into the unlined emergency spillway.”

The agency noted that DWR and CAL FIRE crews in past days have been clearing trees and brush from the path water is expected to take in the emergency spillway, an unlined hillside. The emergency spillway flows are expected to wash large amounts of soil and debris into the Feather River, and crews are positioned to remove as much debris as possible from the channel immediately downstream of the dam.

"The total flow of water from the reservoir, including the emergency spillway, is expected to be on the order of half of downstream flood system capacity and consistent with releases made at this time of year in wet years such as this. While DWR does not expect flows to exceed downstream channel carrying capacity, the rate of flow into the ungated emergency spillway may change quickly," DWR said.

In a tweet this morning, Peter Gleick, President Emeritus and Chief Scientist of the Pacific Institute, pointed out, "Oroville Dam inflow continues to exceed controlled outflow. Reservoir will rise until flow over emergency spillway equals inflow."

Late yesterday afternoon, over 50 staff from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife completed a rescue of 8 million young salmon and 1 million eyed steelhead eggs at the Feather River Fish Hatchery.

Hatchery staff using 8 trucks relocated the 6.5 million fall-run and spring run Chinooks to the hatchery annex near the Thermalito Afterbay, according to Andrew Hughan, CDFW spokesman. These fish, approximately 1 inch long each, would die from suffocation in the turbid, sediment-laden water if left in the raceways of the hatchery.

Approximately 1.5 million juvenile salmon will remain in the hatchery where they will be benefit from sediment ponds set up to cleanse the water. Engineering staff have also set up a charcoal filtration system utilizing a fire hydrant pump for the 1 million eyed steelhead eggs remaining in the hatchery.

“Right now we consider our rescue operation to be a good success,” said Hughan. “We brought in staff from hatcheries all over the state to help in this emergency effort.”

For more information on the fish rescue, go to: http://www.elkgrovenews.net/2017/02/cdfw-rescues-8-million-young-salmon-1.html 

Critics of the Delta Tunnels project said the Oroville Dam spillway rupture shows how basic dam assessments, management plans, and maintenance are being neglected as Governor Jerry Brown constantly promotes the California WaterFix as the "solution” to the state’s water supply and ecosystem problems.

“According to the American Society of Engineers 2013 Report, there are 678 high hazard dams in California, and 48% of them do not have an emergency plan,” said Barbara Barrigan-Parrilla, executive director of Restore the Delta, responding to the Oroville Dam rupture on February 8. “Watching the damage unfold at Oroville, it is striking to us that Governor Brown, CA WaterFix proponents, and Department of Water Resources leaders keep telling Californians that the tunnels are the needed fix for updating California’s water delivery system, yet basic dam assessments, management plans, and maintenance are forgotten or put off."

“The Federal Government had indicated that Oroville Dam needed a further seismic assessment, but the Department of Water Resources stated in 2013 that a seismic assessment of Oroville Dam was not needed. What would happen if an earthquake were to happen near the dam today during this high water event?” she said.

In the Northern Sierras, 60 miles north of Sacramento. Lake Oroville is a large reservoir that holds a significant portion of CA’s water supply. Next time you eat a salad  much of the water in the vegetables likely came from Lake Oroville.

Huge earthen dam. Biggest? in the US, I think

All the area is saturated with water. California in NS strips are pieces of transported rock terranes that are slapped onto the mainland over geologic time. California, west of the Sierras, is shattered rock. So, the underlying stability of the bedrock is problematic. This will not be an easy fix at all. The dam was underengineered when there was need for water and the fact that there was no info about the climate variability to model the max water volumes at the time.

To be clear, the “emergency spillway” is just an ordinary hillside next to the dam they’re going to dump millions of gallons of water down, which will completely wash away the earth, animals, vegetation and whatever else naturally existed there, in short order.  

Which is why it’s called the “emergency spillway.”  It’s the last desperate way to stop running from water over the top of the dam (or down the damaged real spillway) not some sort of “solution” for the damaged spillway.  

This is normally called a “massive flood,” or “major earth slide.”  (In this case it will be both.)  

Someone has decided it’s more cost effective to wreck the hillside than the damaged the concrete spillway.

Regardless, the river downstream will be filled with dirt and “debris” (otherwise known as plants and animals) and whatever naturally existed on that hillside.

Humans have proven once again how much smart they are than Nature.

And climate change continues to be a Chinese hoax.

That natural hillside appears to be part of the dam.  I can’t imagine it would be good to saturate it with water.  It makes me think of the hills in Darington Wa that turned to mud, liquefaction, after extended rain and buried a small neighborhood.

It’s true that saturated soil doesn’t have the strength of unsaturated soil. However, earthen dams have some water moving through them at normal pool anyway; if the dam has stood for many years it is probably a stable situation.  Phreatic line

Here in Iowa when the ‘97 flood went down the emergency spillway, it cut a twenty foot deep gash. The Army Corps of Engineers has developed it as a nature study site called the Devonian Gorge because of all the fossils revealed there.

No, that’s the badly damaged main spillway you’re looking at. The emergency spillway is the unimproved side of the hill.

A better term for these types of spillways is “auxiliary spillway”, IMO.  Part of the design of a dam is to provide a place for water to flow when you have an incoming flow that is greater than what the principal spillway and reservoir can pass/store safely.  Hence  auxiliary (emergency) spillway. 

.

Flow events which would activate the auxiliary spillway are rare events (or they used to be, before global warming).  Here in Mississippi our design flow for auxiliary spillways is that resulting from a Probably Maximum Precipitation (PMP) storm event; approximately 40” of rain in 24 hours (the rainfall amount varies across the state). 

.

In the case of vegetated earthen auxiliary spillways, the common standard is to use a location where the overflow water will pass over existing ground, as opposed to passing over an area of man-made fill.  That’s because filled areas typically have a much greater erodibility than that of in-situ soils.   Erosion and gullying can still happen, of course.

I really don’t think that’s the issue.  There’s more water coming into the reservoir (Lake Oroville) than can go out through normal means (e.g., the hydropower turbine outlets)..  They can’t stop the water from going down the damaged spillway in order to repair (actually, replace) the the concrete spillway until the amount of water coming in slows down.

The one thing that they definitely don’t want is water going over the top of the dam itself, which is what would happen if they blocked off both the damaged spillway (in order to fix it) and the emergency spillway (in order to prevent a ravine from being created in the hillside).

Lot of rain in the last couple of months, due to “atmospheric rivers”. One storm stalled out over the Feather River watershed this week, which dumped a lot of water into the reservoir — it was going up in feet per hour. (It’s melted some of the snow, which is bad.)

In Dec 2015, the lake level was as low as 649 feet (elevation). Today it is 901. That 252 feet of elevation gain in 14 months — most of it the past 2 months.

There was actually a measure to split the state in the 90s I think. Lots of studies were done and Northern California would have been economically on par with some of the smaller states in the nation. I don’t think the south subsidizes the north as much as you think. We are a smaller population and don’t have same police needs or even educational needs. 

Marijuana is legal now so Humboldt would be a great asset and the agriculture produced here would be an economic asset. 

Plus, we could sell the water to the “congress-created dustbowl” central valley farmers.

Northern California has a lot of anger towards Southern California. Our roads aren’t great because the Federal Transportation funds end up going south to the urban areas. So when there is a drought, and the people up here are expected to conserve water, or our rivers are low and we are told the salmon aren’t worth protecting (lots of Republicans fish our rivers) the people aren’t excited about shipping water south to pay for golf courses, swimming pools and yes even drinking water for cities that chose to exist in the desert.

Similarly, every stream and river in Elko County is flooding, some so severely that it has destroyed roads. In one creek, an earthen dam breached and comprehensively flooded everything downstream, including a small town and threatened to impact Interstate 80, many miles downstream. 

The Humboldt River is flooding all along its length. It appears to be cresting at 10.5 feet which is major flood stage. From my home on the side of a mountain, I see the river has swallowed its floodplain to the northwest of town.

Yeah-Thought of you when the 1000 springs dam failed above Wells. I have worked in N NV for off/on for about 40 years. Impressive water flows this spring.

The devastation on the railroads is serious, well beyond what happened when the Salt Lake rose in the 80’s. The main W-E railroads go through N NV. That will be a big expense for the US to repair that piece.

My dad helped build the spillway in the 60s, he built forms for the concrete being poured. I’m wondering what he would have to say now if he was still around to see this. “I told them they should have built it stronger!” is what I would imagine him saying...

Yeah. The altered rock under the spillway is disconcerting. The geos are tweeting maps about the faults/structures in the area and engineering issues. There is the trade off of reality(geology)/costs/needs that gets figured in times of one hydrologic regime without the million year flood scenario.

There is also the issue that geologists are not taught to consider catastrophes in modelling data. Otherwise there would have been fewer dead vulcanologists.

When I was just a pup covering Capitol Hill, a great storm settled over DC and the Mid-Atlantic. For days and days, it just poured, and the rivers overflowed their banks and several dams broke. It was Tropic Storm Agnes, and it was June, 1972.

Among the hardest-hit areas was Scranton-Wilkes Barre, which was represented in Congress by the colorful Daniel Flood. (Dickensian name, eh?) Flood, a failed Shakespearean actor, would often parade around the Capitol in a cape, he had a waxen moustache, and his floor speeches always drew crowds, because he was both an entertainer and a showboat. Snidely Whiplash had nothing on Dan Flood, especially with that villain’s moustache. It’s a shame C-SPAN wasn’t around then.

But in this case, Danny Flood leaped into action. He was Chair of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, so he called the Pentagon and demanded use of a chopper to fly him back to his district, and for his use during the deluge. He got one immediately. 

“This is one Flood against another,” he said dramatically, as he left the Capitol. 

He arrived in his Pennsylvania district just as the Susquehanna River was cresting, he called the National Weather Service to confirm that it had, in fact, crested, and then called a news conference to announce on live television that he had personally ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to make sure that the River not go even one inch higher. 

To his credit, he worked his tail off to help the district recover from the terrible flooding, even though constituents in Scranton felt he did much more to help Wilkes-Barre. 

Problem with Danny was he also worked his tail off to enrich himself and his cronies, and the Carter Justice Department was ready to throw the book at him for using his power to steer government contracts to get kickbacks. The case was ready to go, when Flood resigned his seat in 1980. He died in relative obscurity fourteen years later. 

If there’s a moral to this story, it is that we can huff and puff all we want, but when the most extreme weather strikes, it’s all up to Mother Nature. Or, I guess, we could pass a law in Congress ordering that the rains in California cease immediately.

Tanker trucks were used to rescue about 8M young salmon and 1M young steelhead.  Including scooping up the tiny ones by hand. One source says this hatchery is 1/3 of CA total. There are also native Chinook salmon, already under severe stress by the years of drought. (Sources: Sacramento Bee, Sac Fox 40, KQED SF)
