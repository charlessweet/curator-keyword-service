Stephen Curry Disagrees with Under Armour, Refers to Trump as an A**

Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank ruffled some feathers on Wednesday, praising President Donald Trump as someone who could be a real "asset" to the country.  

"To have such a pro-business president is something that is a real asset for the country," Plank said. "People can really grab that opportunity... He wants to build things. He wants to make bold decisions and be really decisive."

However, this did not set well with Under Armour's premier athlete Stephen Curry, who said that he agrees with the CEO's statement "if you remove the ‘et’ from asset.”

Curry was asked if he would leave the company's sponsorship over the political debate.

“If there is a situation where I can look at myself in the mirror and say they don’t have my best intentions, they don’t have the right attitude about taking care of people,” Curry said. “If I can say the leadership is not in line with my core values, then there is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldn’t jump off if it wasn’t in line with who I am. So that’s a decision I will make every single day when I wake up. If something is not in line with what I’m about, then, yeah, I definitely need to take a stance in that respect.”
