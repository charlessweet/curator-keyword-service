MoveOn.org on Senator John McCain’s Primary Win, Group Calls on McCain to Unendorse Donald Trump
By Brian Stewart. Wednesday, August 31 2016
Statement from Ilya Sheyman, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action, on Senator John McCain’s fending off a primary challenge from State Senator Kelli Ward:

“As Senator John McCain celebrates his primary election win last night, he now must face an uncomfortable truth: his decades-long legacy of honorable service to our nation remains jeopardized by his continued support for Donald Trump.

“McCain has continued to support Trump despite his relentless attacks against the Gold Star family of Humayun Khan, a U.S. soldier who died in Iraq. Even though McCain has disavowed some of Trump’s more dangerous, racist rhetoric, he continues to support Trump’s candidacy, even as the Republican presidential nominee spreads hate and divides the American people.

“McCain must clearly and fully withdraw his endorsement of Donald Trump. Failure to do so is effectively an acceptance of Donald Trump’s bigoted and racist attacks and something that no American leader should accept.”

After Donald Trump attacked the Gold Star family of Humayun Khan, MoveOn.org members in Arizona, led by U.S. military veteran Nate Terani delivered more than 110,000 petition signatures to McCain’s Arizona and Capitol Hill offices urging the Senator to denounce the Republican Presidential nominee and commit to not supporting Donald Trump.

Earlier this month, 94% of Arizona members of MoveOn.org Political Action voted to endorse Ann Kirkpatrick in the state’s U.S. Senate race. McCain received 3% of votes cast.
