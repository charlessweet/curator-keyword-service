National security adviser and Putin surrogate, Michael Flynn had one of his top deputies rejected by the CIA for a security clearance that would have allowed him on the  National Security Council.  Of course the reaction from Flynn was outrage.

We have a GOP/Trump regime that is infested with Putin lice and we’re going to really need our intelligence agencies to step forward and do the right thing and protect us from the threat from within.  It’s very good to see that some of the agencies are not going to be bullied by Trump, or any of his thugs that he surrounds himself with.

When the Washington Post and NYT are openly bragging about the number of sources that are leaking information to them, you know that the tool bag of our intelligence agencies is rather large and diverse.

From Politico

On Friday, one of Flynn’s closest deputies on the National Security Council, senior director for Africa Robin Townley, was informed that the Central Intelligence Agency had rejected his request for an elite security clearance required for service on the NSC, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation.

...

One of the sources said that the rejection was approved by Trump’s CIA director Mike Pompeo and that it infuriated Flynn and his allies.

...

Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, dismissed as “baloney” any suggestion that the clearance was denied because the intelligence community was trying to brushback Flynn.
This is a challenge for the intelligence agencies like they’ve never seen before.  Never in our history has a hostile foreign power infiltrated our government so deeply.  Many of us here are highly critical of the work these people do, but we need them now more than ever and I hope they will do their jobs better than ever.

And a word about Rep. Adam Schiff.  I have seen a bunch of interviews with this guy and find him extremely impressive.  He’s cool, knowledgeable, and he doesn’t hold back.  I think he’s a rising star in the Democratic party and needs to be elevated by the resistance for the good work he’s doing.

Flynn has been sharply critical of the CIA, and apparently he's regarded by some in the White House as waging "a jihad against the intelligence community." So was this a little chin music by the CIA to warn Flynn to back off? Or was there really some kind of problem with Townley? Maybe someday we'll find out.

It’s been a pleasant surprise that Mattis, Pompeo and Kelly haven’t been Yes men like Trump and Bannon envisioned. Kelly told Bannon to fuck off when Bannon tried to order him to carry out the Muslim Ban even though the courts blocked it and Pompeo didn’t rubber stamp a security clearance for one of Flynn’s cronies.

The main problem (for T****, not for us) with getting rid of him is that then he’s on the outside and not under T****’s control — disgruntled ex-employees, especially those who’ve feel they’ve been scapegoated for doing what the boss wanted, tend to blab. Much of what Flynn blabs is sheer nonsense, but he’d still be a valuable person to interrogate. “Tell us what you know, and you’ll get off with lighter charges” is the usual way you work up the line to the boss.

But the pressure is building for him to leave.

The fault is Trump’s; he drew Flynn into his orbit after Flynn was fired from the DIA (he retired a year earlier than he intended which means he either was chafing the Sec. Of the Army, POTUS or both. Days before he left the army, Flynn was highly critical of Pres. Obama and his superiors in the Pentagon in an interview with Al Jazeera which immediately put him on Trump’s short list since Flynn shared Trump’s loathing of Pres. Obama.

Eyesbright  awesumtenor Feb 11 · 02:44:20 PM
Per Wikipedia.com: On April 30, 2014, Flynn announced his retirement effective later in 2014, about a year earlier than he had been scheduled to leave his position. He was reportedly effectively forced out of the DIA after clashing with superiors over his allegedly chaotic management style and vision for the agency.  In a private email which was leaked online, Colin Powell said that he had heard in the DIA (apparently from later DIA director Vincent R. Stewart) that Flynn got fired because he was "Abusive with staff, didn’t listen, worked against policy, bad management, etc."  According to the New York Times, Flynn exhibited a loose relationship with facts, leading his subordinates to refer to Flynn's repeated dubious assertions as "Flynn facts".

Dubious assertions and “Flynn facts” = lies.

Note, also, that Colin Powell was willing to go on record about Flynn.  I find that remarkable.

I had commented to someone that had briefed Gen.

Googling around trying trying to find information on Townley, I found a couple of posts from Nigeria suggesting what views Townley and Flynn might share.

Flynn, whom President Barack Obama dismissed as Director of the Defence Intelligence Agency, wants robust backing for nationalist, anti-Islamist leaders in North Africa and the Middle East. His Africa Director, former US Marine Corps Sergeant Robin Townley, strongly shares this view. Townley has extensive experience as a counter-intelligence officer and interrogator in Africa and the Middle East.

AFRICA/USA: Calling Trumpsville​, National Accord
Some days later, a Washington insider told The Africa Report that Haftar’s message appeared to have got through to General Michael Flynn, Trump’s national security adviser, and his Africa adviser, Rob Townley, a former sergeant in the US Marine Corps and a national intelligence officer. What is less clear is how much sympathy Townley and Flynn, and, more importantly, President Trump, have for Haftar’s cause.

Adam Schiff is one of the biggest Bluedog/New Democrats in the House. He’s hardcore pro-war, pro-Likud, pro-defense/military-industrial-surveillance state (he’s a leading advocate in the House for domestic spying), and has frequently voted against the majority of progressive Democrats, with his name appearing on the short-list of “those Democrats who voted with the GOP,” as noted in diaries here, more times than I can count.

It may be criminal, but it can’t be Treason.

In the entire history of the United States only fifteen people have been convicted of Treason, and only a few more than that have been indicted for this specific crime. Treason is the only crime clearly described in the Constitution and for two centuries federal courts have had a very consistent definition of what constitutes Treason. To be convicted of Treason a US resident has to make war against the US, or give aid and comfort to an “enemy”. The courts have had a consistent definition of the term “enemy” to only include entities involved is a hostile, armed, conflict with the United States. Only one American has been charged with Treason in the Post WWII era, Adam Yahiye Gadahn, who joined al-Qaeda and became a recruiter and Internet spokesman. He was killed in a drone strike in 2015 and never brought to trial.

Russia, and its predecessor the USSR, has never met the definition of “enemy” and that is why during our long cold war with the Soviets no American was charged with Treason for spying, or collaborating with the USSR. Most were charged under the Espionage Act, and some were executed, but none were ever charged with Treason. So nothing that happened before or after the 2016 election, domestically in Congress or regarding the interference of the Russians in the general election could ever be indicted as Treason. Crimes may have been committed, but not Treason.

Your logic is sound. So, if not treason, how about Flynn be charged under the Logan Act?

The Logan Act (1 Stat. 613, 18 U.S.C. § 953, enacted January 30, 1799) is a United States federal law that forbids unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments having a dispute with the U.S. It was intended to prevent the undermining of the government's position.[2] The Act was passed following George Logan's unauthorized negotiations with France in 1798, and was signed into law by President John Adams on January 30, 1799. The Act was last amended in 1994, and violation of the Logan Act is a felony.

To date, only one person has ever been indicted for violating the act's provisions.[2]However, no person has ever been prosecuted for alleged violations of the act.[2]

The Logan Act is interesting in that it has been on the books for two centuries, but no one has been prosecuted under it. Flynn’s actions appear to be a textbook example of a violation of the Act. It will be interesting to see what develops and if Flynn is even charged with any crime.

If there were private illegal conversations in the past, then in all of the years before international telephony, it would be difficult to prove what was said without testimony from one of the participants. Since then, for a long time wiretapping was specific and also difficult. These days with mass data collection of foreign nationals’ conversations by the NSA, proof might be available if they want to disclose it in court.

But I digress. According to WaPo, 9 intelligence people leaked this story. Good probability there are more than those 9 willing to symbolically drive the final nail in Flynn’s coffin.

I think treason is on the table for Trump and anyone working for him who actively collaborated with Russia in attacking our electoral system. You are correct that Treasom has only very rarely been invoked and there is certainly no precedent you can point to to say that Russian collaborators are clearly guilty of treason. But I don't think there is precedent that says it is not treason either. And I think Russia’s actions were sufficiently aggressive and hostile that the label “enemy” would not necessarily be misapplied. I by no means think this is an open and shut case of treason but I wouldn't be too hasty to dismiss the charge either. I think this is potentially the most fundamental attack on our national identity since the civil war. I think treason captures the gravity of the American participants’ actions the way no other charge could.

VClib  seanwright Feb 11 · 02:18:17 PM
There are two centuries of precedent that it isn’t Treason. We had Americans who were Russian spies who stole critical secrets of our atomic bomb program and were not charged with Treason. The Courts have been very clear that Treason only occurs in a “hot” war. There are numerous other criminal statutes that can be used and no federal prosecutor is going to charge Treason, when it would be easy for the defense to win that part of the case. 

Frankly, I am perplexed by the fact that so many people have both an affinity for calling so many actions Treason, and so little understanding of the law and its history.

In casual conversation, as opposed to a legal charge before a court of law, treason carries an effective emotional connotation that the more appropriate legal term does not. It’s not like a comment on a blog is going to determine a prosecutor’s list of charges, if these treasonous scumbags even ever face legal charges, which I hope they do.

Stealing nuclear secrets is an act of espionage. I think the interference in our election is qualitatively different from stealing our secrets. I think it could fairly be characterized as an attack. I've probably tried as many treason cases as you have and I know how to read statutes and case law. I don't think there is a requirement for a “hot” war as you say.  Would your analysis be different if we were talking about American citizens who collaborated with Russia to shut down the power grid for a significant portion of the country for an extended period of time? Is it the abstraction of the attack that makes you so confident that collaboration by an American citizen could never be deemed treason? I acknowledge that it would be a novel application of the law, but it's a novel situation and novel application does not equal misapplication.

You make a fair point, however we have new laws specifically for the acts you mention and would likely try the cases as terrorism. And if those acts were committed I don’t think a prosecutor would charge Treason, given the history of the law and how it has been applied. Federal prosecutors (and I was married to one for a very long time) are notoriously conservative in how they build and indict cases. I don’t see anyone attempting a Treason indictment. Even more specifically Jeff Sessions will never charge another Republican with Treason.

I agree that it's a stretch. I just don't think it's a stretch for which a reasonable case cannot be made. I do a fair amount of criminal defense but I must admit that no one I've ever represented has been charged with a rarely invoked constitutionally defined crime. Federal prosecutors are generally conservative when it comes to bringing charges but they seem willing to get a little creative when they are dealing with sophisticated actors engaged in complex crimes with political implications — e.g. Scooter Libby and John Edwards.

I used to be in Rep. Adam Schiff’s district and I would say his good qualities are hard as stone. While he’s not someone who resembles a progressive, in my opinion, I frequently think of him when reflecting on a certain type of person who is extremely stable and grounded within himself as a person. It would be interesting to see how he would respond to a successful progressive wave. I’m not sure how flexible he is on the issues that matter to Berniacs like me.

This looks fishy. Townley had a TS clearance for years as a uniformed intelligence officer and likely had some level of code word clearance.

At the same time, Trump himself rejected war criminal Eliot Abrams for the 2nd in charge post at State, despite Tillerson asking for him. Before you start to wonder if maybe Trump is more liberal than he lets on, it was because Abrams wrote some mean things about him during the primaries, and when he found out, he ordered that his application be rejected. Yeah, this really happened. I woudn’t quite say that the Trump administration is coming apart at the seams, but green shoots abound.

Will Trumps coercion with Putin and the Russians be fully investigated? 
 
I'm not happy that the proper attention isn't being given to this story. 
The facts as we know them today is that there is significant evidence that the Russians interfered in the election. 
How and to what extent? 
The facts as we know them today are that Flynn did indeed speak to the Russian ambassador as Obama was putting sanctions in place. We also know that the Russians did not react as they normally would after these types of sanctions are made. 
What promises were made that made Putin confident that the sanctions would be lifted right after they were made and before the inauguration? 
Are these 2 things separate events not related to each other? Or was this part of a larger issue where the Russians are responsible for who we have as president? Did they put in place who they wanted and for what reasons? What does Trump have to provide the Russians in return? 
The amount of time and energy that Congress spent on HRC's email server when in fact there was no there there - can anyone imagine what Congress would have done if there had been the slightest evidence that HRC or BHO had colluded with American sworn enemy? 
There is much ore to this story and I believe that the Trump Presidency is illegitimate that with the Russians assistance they took down HRC and over threw the US Government! 
Does Trump or Putin have some thing on FBI Director Comey? How does one explain his political interference at a crucial time leading up to the election? This is unprecedented and there are a lot more questions to come on this. 
But who is going to ask them? The Congress isn't interested even when it's entirely possible they are working for the enemy a foreign power is pulling their strings! 
Wake up people - we were all shocked at the outcome of our election - every poll gave this thing to HRC - how could all the data, all the industries that operate around elections be WRONG!
