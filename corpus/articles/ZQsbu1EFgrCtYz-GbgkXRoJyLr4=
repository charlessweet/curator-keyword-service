Drumpf's continuous proclamations that there was massive voter fraud, allowing extra votes for Hillary Clinton, could backfire, if it were true, which it isn’t. What if his so-called massive voter fraud, were in the vote for him, in the Electoral College? What if he didn’t win the Electoral College, but had help winning it, since it would be much easier that way, than trying to prove massive fraud, in the Popular Vote. What’s to say his “special friend” Putin, hadn’t helped him win the Electoral College? 

If there was supposedly such a massive voter fraud, which there wasn't, how does he know the so-called fraudulent votes were actually for Hillary?  What if the so-called fraud was actually in votes for Drumpf, in the Electoral College, which allowed him to win those states and thus the Electoral College, then the Presidency!

Even though there were almost 3 million popular votes, for Hillary, what if the so-called fraud, was in the determining states, of the Electoral College, which would then prove, there was fraud, in those states, to help Drumpf win those Electoral votes, when they should have gone to Hillary?

In his continuous proclamations of "MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD", what's to say the fraud was not in the Electoral college, which guaranteed he was a winner, even though the popular vote had gone to Hillary, by almost 3 million votes?

Yes. That he narrowly flipped the three states he needed to is suspicious. But we have a Dem SOS in Michigan. I could see Scott Walker up to no good in WI. But MI and PA are legit
