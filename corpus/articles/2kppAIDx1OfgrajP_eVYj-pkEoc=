TODAY IS THE DAY of giving. Join us and donate at www.givingheartsday.org. Search for uCodeGirl among the charities tab.
Coding is today's universal language. In the next decade, 80% of jobs across every industry will require technology language skills. #uCodeGirl understands this and prepares young girls by providing programming that empowers, engages and enriches them with real-world knowledge.

Last summer, we had a blast with these future Game Changers. We had fun creating coding games, being inspired by women in tech and experiencing the real-world via field trips to tech companies. We are excited for our 2017 summer in-depth immersion program: Crack the Code: Tech Day Camp for Girls!
By donating just $25 to uCodeGirl, you'll be sending a girl on a field trip, opening her eyes to the world of coding. Learn more about our mission and don't forget to make your impact on February 9th! http://bit.ly/2k5rDc9

By 2020, there will be 1.4 million unfilled tech jobs in the US due to a shortage of qualified engineers.
