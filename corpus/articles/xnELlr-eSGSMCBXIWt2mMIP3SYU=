Though Ivanka Trump is a strong, passionate, accomplished woman, liberals have been attacking her non-stop ‚Äî passively and aggressively ‚Äî for her father‚Äôs views (and a few of her own). This is not only hypocritical but disheartening: It shows liberals care more about ideology than accomplishment, about political policies, rather than personal goals.

Attacks from the Left
Before Ivanka Trump was ‚Äúfirst daughter,‚Äù of President Donald Trump, she was a business woman whose apparel and accessory lines were sold at various outlets nationwide. As successes go, the brand has done okay: Forbes reports,

Her clothing line alone -- a collection of mid-priced, work-appropriate dresses and skirts, mostly -- did $100 million in revenues in the last fiscal year, according to G-iii, the $2.3 billion (market cap) apparel giant that manufactures and distributes Ivanka's wares [...] its 2016 annual report notes a $29.4 million increase in sales of Ivanka Trump's fashion line from the year before.
While there was little sign distributors were unhappy with her merchandise before her father took office, recently Nordstrom, and then T.J. Maxx, pulled Ivanka‚Äôs lines from their shelves, citing poor sales, presumably a post-election drop. While it‚Äôs certainly possible sales dipped in the few weeks Trump has been president, would a major retailer dump the brand, after a slight dip in less than a month‚Äôs time? Doubtful. Would a major retailer dump the brand of a conservative woman whose father happens to be a Republican president. I‚Äôll take ‚ÄúTales of Clothing Revenge‚Äù for $500, Alex.

This seems silly, for starters. While Ivanka‚Äôs been in the spotlight more than any other of Trump‚Äôs children, she‚Äôs not the most politically conservative, pushing her father to the left on LGBT issues. (There‚Äôs rumor she helped stop an executive order that would have reversed LGBT workplace protections.) Even if she were completely aligned with her father politically, she‚Äôs his daughter ‚Äî not the first lady or an elected official. While she‚Äôs certainly acted the part of the first lady ‚Äî Melania is much quieter and is remaining in New York for now ‚Äî Ivanka‚Äôs eschewed that role officially and is carving out a position suited to her skills and Trump‚Äôs desires. The point is: Why should she be punished for her father‚Äôs views? Nepotism, if that‚Äôs how liberals view her White House presence, may be frustrating, but all administrations, Republican and Democrat, participate in that. Hello, Clintons?

This is hypocritical
Second, department stores folding Trump‚Äôs line because of her father‚Äôs political policies is hypocritical. Can you imagine Macy‚Äôs doing this if Chelsea Clinton had a clothing line a few years back? Or, if Sasha and Malia Obama had been a little older when their father became president? Democrats, the media, and certainly Nordstrom would be giving the girls a pass on their behavior, endeavors, and screw-ups. (They often did.)

What about intentions? What about the fact that she‚Äôs never held political office? Or even the fact that her father has never held political office prior to winning the November 2016 election? These are all phrases we‚Äôd be hearing as excuses if this were a Democrat administration. Somehow there‚Äôs little grace for a Republican.

This silly quibbling and blatant hypocrisy is yet another reason why Trump garnered so many votes, even with Ivanka at his side.

Even when Ivanka seems to be doing all the right things, she‚Äôs doing them wrong. This week Ivanka, who often tweets or posts pictures on Instagram of private moments, tweeted a photo of herself taking a call in the White House while holding her young son. She doesn‚Äôt even say a word about politics. Yet she was subjected to backlash and vitriol. Comedian Ilana Glazer responded:


If moments like that are stirring up the interwebs, it‚Äôs going to be a long four years for Ivanka ‚Äî and the rest of us watching.

Why isn‚Äôt Ivanka a feminist role model?
Nepotism aside ‚Äî everyone knows it happens in politics on both sides of the aisle ‚Äî it‚Äôs hard to understand why feminists aren‚Äôt applauding Ivanka Trump with a standing ovation every time she tweets or grants an interview. She‚Äôs everything they advocate: Hard-working, articulate, an entrepreneur, (soon to be) author, mom, wife, and more. While she certainly had a leg-up being the daughter of a wealthy business man, she has earned some things fair and square, like an economics degree from the Wharton School of Finance. In 2014, well before the campaign, Fortune dubbed her 33rd on their ‚Äú40 under 40‚Äù list, and she even spoke at the ‚ÄúMost Powerful Women Summit‚Äù in Washington.

Let‚Äôs face it, if Ivanka posted a picture on Instagram outside her voting center wearing a #ImWithHer sticker, she‚Äôd be profiled in every feminist rag, virtual and physical out there. This alone shows feminism isn‚Äôt just about women earning a fair wage, working outside the home, and juggling babies. It‚Äôs about ideology that advances liberal thought. Ivanka does that less than the average feminist (and more than the average conservative!) so she‚Äôs already being mocked, ridiculed, and devalued. While I don‚Äôt agree with her every political viewpoint, she‚Äôs a role model for young women. She‚Äôs worked hard, enjoys a solid career, and seems to be a dedicated wife and mother. What‚Äôs not to love? This silly quibbling and blatant hypocrisy is yet another reason why Trump garnered so many votes, even with Ivanka at his side. If liberals keep this up, it will only prove this point over and over ‚Äî and discredit their own ideology simultaneously.
