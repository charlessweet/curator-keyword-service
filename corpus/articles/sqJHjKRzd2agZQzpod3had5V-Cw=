The White House responded Thursday night to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling against President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration.

Kellyanne Conway said the Trump administration will not be swayed on their determination to prove their case.

“This ruling does not affect the merits at all,” Conway said on Fox News. “We are confident that when we get our day in court, we will prevail on the merits.”

When asked about the options the administration has, Conway said there are several.

“There are different options here,” added Conway, who is Trump’s counselor.  “I’m commenting on the fact we have an excellent case here in regard to the merits.”
