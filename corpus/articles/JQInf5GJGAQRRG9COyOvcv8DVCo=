Most of the failings (and there are many) of modern education result from a simple misunderstanding of how children learn. Since we were all children at one point, it‚Äôs puzzling that we should be so forgetful of our own childhood attitudes, including the knee-jerk rejection of things forced upon us, without regard for our own preferences. It is a common misconception that the way to make children learn more, faster, and better, is to give them ever increasing amounts of schoolwork.

In the quest for better education, people have proposed extending the school day and doing away with summer vacation. A more cynical man might suspect that the motives for these recommendations lie rather in apathetic parents wanting free daycare, rather than a genuine desire for academic excellence. But in this instance at least, I have chosen to remain charitable in my interpretation.

Flashback: Texas teacher declares no homework, ever!

What these proposals miss is the fact that the will of a child functions rather like a Chinese finger trap: The more pressure you apply, the less progress you make.

One elementary school in Vermont is learning this lesson. Several months ago, the school voted to eliminate all homework requirements for children below the fifth grade. To many, this will seem like an insane idea. How will children learn if they are not constantly drilled with written assignments to complete after school hours? It‚Äôs the wrong question to ask. A better one would be, ‚ÄúHow will children learn when you turn all the most interesting things about the world into a tedious chore?‚Äù

The answer is, ‚ÄúNot very well.‚Äù And it turns out that relaxing these chores improves student outcomes considerably. Parents are reporting that, following the ‚Äúno homework‚Äù policy, their children are reading more recreationally and improving their literacy skills, in general. Even formerly skeptical parents have admitted the success of the policy, which results in happier children who actually enjoy learning, instead of regarding it as mere necessary tedium.

We must always remember that children are not machines. They cannot be programmed with knowledge at a rate determined by professional educators or government policymakers.

Encouraging natural learning without coercion is the philosophy behind some forms of homeschooling, including the unschooling method under which yours truly was educated, and for which I remain a committed advocate.

It‚Äôs also a good example of why it‚Äôs important to maintain choice and flexibility in education policy. When individual schools are free to try new things, to experiment, and to take risks, they will stumble upon breakthroughs such as the ‚Äúno homework‚Äù policy that work in spite of expert expectations. When the curriculum is rigidly controlled from the top down for the sake of uniformity and so-called ‚Äúquality control,‚Äù such advances become impossible to the detriment of the students.

We must always remember that children are not machines. They cannot be programmed with knowledge at a rate determined by professional educators or government policymakers. You cannot demand that they solve problems and spit out answers with the regularity of a computer. They are complex human beings, undergoing a process of discovery in an effort to understand the world around them. The process can be filled with wonder and delight, or it can be filled with drudgery, shame, and frustration. When the school environment reflects that latter rather than the former, there is no doubt that the results will be failure.
