After a long a bruising battle, including serious attacks on his character, the Senate finally confirmed Jeff Sessions as attorney general by a vote of 52-47.

Casting aside its traditional deference to a fellow senator, Democrat senators, reflecting the divisive political environment, blasted Sessions during the confirmation hearings and on the Senate floor. 
Senator Cory Booker, D-N.J. (F, 16%) made history in his opposition to Sessions. It was the first time a sitting senator testified against another senator serving in the Senate during a confirmation hearing. 

Sessions overcame numerous insulting disparaging attacks including claims from early in his career that he was racially insensitive and joked about the KKK. 

Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. (F, 18%) lead the charge by attacking Sessions on race. Warren’s challenge to Sessions was so intense that she broke chamber rules and was silenced for criticizing Sessions on the Senate floor. 

Warren quoted from a letter written by the late Coretta Scott King, wife of the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who objected to Sessions' federal judgeship nomination in 1986 on racial grounds. 

Alveda King, the niece of Dr. and Mrs. King, criticized Senator Warren for playing the race card by invoking the King name by reciting the letter.

Senator Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. (F, 16%) was the only Democrat to vote in favor of Sessions' nomination.

King told Fox Business Network's host Neil Cavuto, “Aunt Coretta was a very reasonable woman and she, with integrity, would have noted that he had done some great work in fighting against discrimination.” 

“I believe certainly that if she could look at the record of Sen. Sessions today, with integrity, she would say, ‘Well, he has worked to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan; he has worked to desegregate public schools.” 

King continued, “So it’s almost like a bait and switch, stir up their emotions, use the name King — and my name is Alveda King — stir up people’s emotions [and] play the race card, which she was attempting to do.” 

Senator Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. (F, 16%) was the only Democrat to vote in favor of Sessions' nomination.

Warren made her frustrations known by unleashing a barrage of Tweets on Twitter.


Race became such an emotional and prominent issue with Sessions that even Senator Tim Scott, R-S.C. (B, 89%) faced extremely harsh and racially charged backlash for supporting Sessions.

Scott took to the Senate floor to read a few racist comments to his colleagues he received in Tweets.

Senator Tim Scott is not an Uncle Tom — he doesn’t have a shred of honor. He’s a house negro, like the one in ‘Django [Unchained].’
[Mr. Scott is a] black man who is racist against black people. Big Uncle Tom piece of fertilizer.
You are a disgrace to your race.
How does a black man turn on his own?
“I left out all the ones that use the n-word. I just felt like that would not be appropriate.” said Scott, “Just felt like that would not be appropriate.”

Scott also commented about the left's intolerance when it comes to disagreeing with them.

You see what I’m surprised by, just a smidgen, is that the liberal left that speaks and desires the rest of us to be tolerant do not want to be tolerant of anyone that disagrees with where they are coming from.
Scott continued, “So the definition of tolerance isn’t that all Americans experience a high level of tolerance; it’s that all Amer­i­cans that agree with them experiences this so-called tolerance.”

Even with Sessions’ nomination and after nearly three weeks in office, President Trump is still waiting for Senate confirmation of eight Cabinet positions and many administration posts including the EPA and the director of the Office of Management and Budget.
