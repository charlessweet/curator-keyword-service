In Santa Monica, California, the government provides free Wi-Fi for the citizens. Isn't that great?
Maybe it would be, if it actually worked. In fact, you can't connect. I guess you get what you pay for.
We should apply this same logic to other government services. If it's "free", odds are it's not going to work very well.
