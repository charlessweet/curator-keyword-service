Diagnosed with PTSD ...served two tours in Afghanistan and pleaded guilty for cocaine conviction and is a resident and VETERAN… Perez may likely get deported.

Judge reviewing the case and Tammy Duckworth has written a letter on his behalf.

This has got to stop !!!!!

I know many veterans who have gotten into trouble and most of the time it was drug related but managed to become even activists for good.

I wonder if The Donald is cracking down on so much of this his way because the Mexican Cartel has interfered with his own Mafia connections.   I do not condone this veteran’s activity but he fought for America and was willing to take a bullet.   Now America or a so called America cannot say, “ We owe you a place here with your family”?

There was a lot of action at that time," said Perez, 38, a Mexican-born legal permanent resident of the U.S. and a decorated Army veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan. "I didn't think I was coming back. Just seeing the 50 stars and stripes did something to my skin. It was incredible, ecstasy, nirvana."

Now, after returning to the country he's called home for 30 years, Perez faces possible deportation to Mexico following a felony drug conviction.

Perez is one of many veterans, some of whom sustained injuries and emotional trauma during combat, who have been decorated for service, then confronted with the possibility of deportation after committing a crime. As with many others, Perez mistakenly thought he became a U.S. citizen when he took an oath to protect the nation. He discovered that was not the case when he was summoned to immigration court shortly before his release from a state penitentiary, where he had served seven years for handing over a bag of cocaine to an undercover police officer.

{{{Vetwife}}} Not just vets but active service people need to stand up on this one.  Presupposing they live long enough — which pvl45 is trying to “fix” — they will be vets some day and might like to have a few of the benefits they’ve earned/were promised.  Including the one about not being deported if you serve in the U.S. military.

This is terrible. Rec’d and tipped to bring more eyes. There seems to be a systemic problem here that we might be able to do something about — perhaps write Tammy Duckworth?

I think he is doing this now because he got shut down in the courts and also because he maybe feels that all of us out there protesting all the time against him and making fun of him is humiliating and this is him taking revenge. The people that he is deporting are not threats to our society-but he know it will be very upsetting to us.

This is unbelievable! Anyone and everyone can make a mistake! Perez is a decorated vet while Trump was a Vietnam draft dodger (regardless of his doctors note). Compassion does not exist in Trump's America. This has to stop. His actions will backfire on our country and make us less, not more secure. Trump is just waiting and wishing for another terrorist attack so he can try to make this country a dictatorship.

Think about this.  Non-citizen veterans, women who check in with ICE on a schedule.  The government knows who these people are.  They are easy to find and deport and then claim they’ve deported “millions”  of undocumented immigrants with some kind of statistics to prove they did something.  It’s like shooting fish in a barrel.

Yes it is. Now a criminal record of any kind will land you on the list. That could mean even working here without papers or with forged documents. It’s a Catch 22: don’t have papers and you can’t most work, get papers forged and you’ll get a felony conviction for ID theft if caught. That’s what happened in the first deportation under Trump that made national news the other night in Phoenix: Garcia de Rayos was a wife and mother of two who had been here 22 years. Hardly a violent criminal, but she did have a conviction for ID theft because she got caught in one of Sheriff Arpaio’s immigration sweeps (which were later ruled unconstitutional). 

If I were one of the 700K DREAMERs who trusted the government and gave them my name and address, I’d be very nervous now too.

So sad.  We broke him in war and now we deport him.

I read the linked Chicago Tribune story  and it is yet another reminder to everyone:  Apply for citizenship as soon as you are able to.  Unfortunately Mr. Perez assumed he was a citizen.  Don’t assume!  Keep on top of it and verify every step of the way.  If you have an internationally adopted child readopt them in the U.S. so their birth certificate and passport are American and in English.  Don’t feel safe until you have the highest level of legal and paper protection.

I was a resident mgr. of a transitional housing apt.  Meaning the residents had all been homeless.  They were roughly 1/3 in recovery from substance abuse, 1/3 mentally ill, and 1/3 veterans.  The categories by whatever most qualified them, which did not mean only one applied.  That “we broke him” comment seems apt to me.  Add the results of the de facto economic draft, which sure applies in my own family.  Absolutely makes me see red— which is why we need to see much, much more blue.

Naturalization at Basic Training

USCIS established the Naturalization at Basic Training Initiative in August 2009 with the Army to give noncitizen enlistees the opportunity to naturalize when they graduate from basic training. Under this initiative, USCIS conducts all naturalization processing including the capture of biometrics, the naturalization interview and administration of the Oath of Allegiance on the military installation. Since 2009 USCIS has expanded the initiative to the Navy, Air Force, and finally to the Marine Corps in 2013, giving enlistees of these branches equal opportunity to (in most cases) leave basic training as U.S. citizens.

Thanks for posting this link. I have been wondering where the “military heads” are at, regarding Trump. The Seal Team convoy outside Louisville, that were driving down the freeway flying Trump flags a couple weeks ago, had me thinking they were all gung-ho for him. Should have figured it was an anything-but-monolithic view; lots of nuance and differences of opinion in the armed forces, as everywhere.

My military MOS was neuro-psychiatric specialist. In 1970 after newspaper articles on the widespread use of heroin in Vietnam, I was dispatched to work on drug withdrawal in Nam. I saw patients who were using not only heroin but phenobarbital and others. A common remark when I would ask why they started and continued using was “ It helps take away the pain for a while”. Of course, the pain they were speaking of wasn’t physical.

Until one has walked in another’s shoes, it is easy to criticize but difficult to understand. I have heard the same phrase among users in civilian life. Mr. Perez is carrying pains that neither Donald Trump nor any ICE agent who didn’t serve could start to fathom. He and any others in similar circumstance deserve our gratitude and not our venom.

It's not uncommon for an undocumented individual to serve in the US military and then be given permanent legal status as a reward for their service. The caveat is that like all others with this legal status they can't be convicted of serious crimes. Doing so could cause their status to be revoked. The military needs to provide legal counsel,or explain in very clear terms that permanent legal status is not citizenship before the person signs up. They also need to help them understand actions that could lead to revocation of their status. That would be a start. I hate what's going on right now, but we wouldn't be in this place if either party had passed common sense immigration reform years ago. I don't know if it could have helped the man in your diary's situation, but it would have helped millions of others.

Sandy1: Recruiters don’t care and they would have to be legally mandated that incoming service members be fully informed of what their actual rights are in terms of maintaining full citizen rights. But many are young when they show up to be recruited with not fully formed adult brains with full logic and reasoning capabilities — that is the reason why so many will show up and sign up. Recruiters take advantage of that age group’s romanticism about war. It’s the government that needs to do their job at full information on consequences at sign up.

There are always a lot of people known to the system who are eligible for deportation.  Under Republican administrations, resources limit the number of these people who are rounded up and deported.  Under Democratic administrations, compassion comes into play.

Trump’s EO basically ordered ICE to round everyone up regardless of the resource cost.  ICE is going after the easiest targets first to get the most deported for the least amount of resources.

I am wondering where these people are going, you can’t just drive them across the border and dump them in Mexico.  The Mexican authorities need to approve each returnee.  Without some proof that a returnee is a actually a Mexican citizen, the Mexican authorities won’t accept them.  I suspect that most are being detained somewhere in the US while they are being processed.  I also suspect that they are only going after people they believe to be Mexican citizens and skipping over undocumented people from other countries.  This is just as much about our poor relationship with Mexico right now as it is about reducing the number of undocumented workers here in the US.

Detention during processing is one of the drivers for the sanctuary city “movement.”  Local authorities can’t afford to detain people indefinitely waiting for ICE to show up.  ICE was using local facilities as an off-the-books detention resource and that is what triggered some sanctuary cities to start looking at the issue. 

Can’t wait to see the overtime bill on this one as well as how much we are going to be paying to detain people while Mexico slow walks their own approval process.  Guessing we are going to see concentration camp conditions within the detention centers in the very near future.

It is my understanding that the agreement with people from other countries that go into our military are granted citizenship for this service to the country.

This is beyond chicken shit, this is despicable.
