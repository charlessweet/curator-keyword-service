HOOVER, AL (WSFA) -
A 5-year-old girl is safe with family members following the cancellation of an Amber Alert issued Monday afternoon by the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. 

The child, McKenzie Mixon, was apparently abducted by her father, 34-year-old Jeffrey Mixon, after he allegedly killed someone at the Cypress Gardens Apartments in Hoover, a suburb of Birmingham, Monday morning.

Hoover police believed Mixon and his child were possibly headed toward Selma, and authorities issued the Amber Alert believing the child was in extreme danger.

Mixon turned himself in to authorities at the Dallas County Jail around 2:15 p.m. The child was found with relatives in Plantersville and was not harmed.

Mixon is accused of committing a "domestic homicide" though no details have been released about the victim.

Specific charges against Mixon have yet to be released.
